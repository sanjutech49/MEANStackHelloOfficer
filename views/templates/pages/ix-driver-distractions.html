        <h1 class="text--center"><span>IX.</span> DRIVER DISTRACTIONS</h1>

        <hr>

        <p>Driver distractions are serious problems and warrant a good, long look at their dangers and how to avoid them. As is usually the case, the most effective method of ending an epidemic is education. Did you know that 80% of accidents and 65% of near-misses are directly related to some form of driver distraction? The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) published a report stating these facts and also found that the distracting event occurred within three seconds of the collision. To give you even more clarity, 3,328 people were killed in crashes involving driver distractions in 2012 alone!</p>

        <p>Below are some other extremely alarming statistics published by D!STRACTION.GOV:<sub>50</sub></p>

        <ul>
          <li>The number of people killed in distraction-affected crashes decreased slightly from 3,360 in 2011 to 3,328 in 2012. An estimated 421,000 people were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving a distracted driver; this was a nine percent increase from the estimated 387,000 people injured in 2011.</li>
          <li>10% of all drivers under the age of 20 involved in fatal crashes were reported as distracted at the time of the crash. This age group has the largest proportion of drivers who were distracted.</li>
          <li>Drivers in their 20s make up 27 percent of the distracted drivers in fatal crashes. (NHTSA)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>What is Distracted Driving?</strong></p>
        <p>Now that we have grabbed your attention with those frightening statistics, let’s take a deeper look into what it means to be a distracted driver. Our friends at D!STRACTION.GOV define distracted driving as “any activity that could divert a person's attention away from the primary task of driving.”</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <img src="../images/curriculum-images/24-ix-intro.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Image of driver looking through purse">
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>There are three primary categories of being distracted:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Manual:</strong> removing your hands from the steering wheel</li>
          <li><strong>Visual:</strong> taking your eyes off of the road</li>
          <li><strong>Cognitive:</strong> taking your mind off of driving</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Every such activity puts the lives of the driver, passenger, and any other individual in the vicinity of the distracted driver in danger. There are a plethora of potential distracting activities that could occur while on the road. For example, let’s take a look at the following list of possibilities:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Texting*</li>
          <li>Using a cell phone or smartphone in any capacity</li>
          <li>Initiating or receiving a phone call on a hands free device</li>
          <li>Eating and/or drinking</li>
          <li>Talking to passengers</li>
          <li>Tending to an infant or toddler</li>
          <li>Tending to unrestrained pets</li>
          <li>Applying make-up or other grooming activities</li>
          <li>Reading (including maps, directions, billboards, etc.)</li>
          <li>Using a GPS device or other navigation system</li>
          <li>Watching videos</li>
          <li>Changing a radio station, CD, or MP3 player or adjusting the sound quality on any of these devices</li>
          <li>Looking at scenery or gawking at an accident</li>
          <li>Flirting with attractive neighboring drivers</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>* Text messaging is by far the most dangerous of all distractions because it requires multiple levels of driver attention (i.e., visual, manual, and cognitive) at once.</em> You get the picture. Distractions are everywhere. Driving requires our full and complete attention if we want to arrive at our destination safely. There are so many complexities involved in driving a vehicle and you must constantly be engaged in your task or risk an accident. Even if you have 20 years or more of driving experience under your belt, every trip is full of new neighbors on the road, new obstacles and new hazards. So put your cell phone down, delay that breakfast sandwich or cup of coffee, strap your pets in safe restraining devices, and commit to a playlist before starting your journey.</p>

        <h3><span>A.</span> DOING OTHER THINGS</h3>

        <p>Now that we’ve taken a look at the alarming statistics related to the dangers of distracted driving, let’s take a closer look at some of the other things that are vying for your attention while behind the wheel.</p>

        <h4><span>1.</span> Eating</h4>

        <p>We are in an age of multi-tasking and using every minute “efficiently.” Sit-down family dinners are a thing of the past and most meals are eaten on the go. My commentary on the degradation of society and our quality of life aside, planning to eat in the car is also hazardous for your health. Eating in the car is dangerous! If you think I’m exaggerating, let’s think about this. Not only do you have at least one hand off the wheel to hold your food, you may at times be tempted to use both hands to unwrap or open the food item, clean up a spill, lean or reach for napkins or other components of your picnic, all of which cause a <strong>manual distractions</strong>. Then there’s the <strong>visual distraction</strong> as you look at the object while unwrapping, wiping spills, or preparing to take a bite. You can bet your brain is engaged in thinking about all of these steps and the food in question, so now you’ve added in the <strong>cognitive distraction</strong> too! That is all three methods of being distracted in one seemingly harmless activity. It’s simply not worth the risk. Either eat the food while safely parked in a lot, give yourself ample of time to eat before you hit the road or to grab and eat something at your destination. Not only will you be safer, but you will also actually be able to enjoy your meal more fully.</p>

        <h4><span>2.</span> Hygiene</h4>

        <p>Unless you’re homeless and living out of your car, personal hygiene should be addressed in your home. If you decide to put on make-up, shave, brush your hair, floss, or do any other hygiene-related task in the car, you are putting yourself and others in serious risk. This distraction is another example of pulling all three measures of your attention (<strong>manual, visual</strong> and <strong>cognitive</strong>) away from the important task of driving. It is better to arrive late, without make-up or with a five o’clock shadow than to kill or be killed on the road. </p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h4><span>3.</span> Electronic devices (cell phones/text devices, navigation devices/dashboard screens)</h4>

        <p>Not only is the use of a hand-held communication device dangerous, this particular distraction is also illegal. But we know you are out there using them anyway! We have seen you swerving in traffic, driving well under the speed limit and the flow of traffic, keeping your brake pedal pressed long after the light has turned green, and changing lanes without signaling or checking your blind spot. You might think you are an expert at multitasking, but this is one case where you should not try to showcase your skills!</p>
        <p>Speaking of Illegal…</p>
        <p>In case you don’t enjoy combing through the California Vehicle Code on weekends like I do, here are a couple of excerpts regarding the use of communication devices to make things clear for you and to outline the consequences of breaking the law.</p>
        <img src="../images/curriculum-clipart/clip-art-42.jpg" alt="clipart of man talking on cellphone while driving">
        <p>This first excerpt is related to hand-held wireless telephones:</p>
        <p><em> 23123.  (a) A person shall not drive a motor vehicle while using a wireless telephone unless that telephone is specifically designed and configured to allow hands-free listening and talking, and is used in that manner while driving.</em></p>

        <p><em> Amended Sec. 3, Ch. 214, Stats. 2007. Effective January 1, 2008. Operative July 1, 2011.</em></p>
        <p>The following excerpt is related to electronic wireless communication devices:</p>
        <p><em> 23123.5.

        <p><em> Amended Sec. 1, Ch. 92, Stats. 2012. Effective January 1, 2013.</em></p>
        <p>And the final excerpt is related to telephone use for minors (under age 18):</p>
        <p><em> 23124.  (a) This section applies to a person under the age of 18 years. </em></p>
        <p><em> (b) Notwithstanding ( )1 Sections 23123 and 23123.5, a person described in subdivision (a) shall not drive a motor vehicle while using a wireless telephone ( )2 or an electronic wireless communications device, even if equipped with a hands-free ( )3 device.</em></p>

        <p><strong>More Alarming Statistics</strong></p>
        <p>Why are the lawmakers so stringent when it comes to what most people seem to think is a harmless activity? Let’s review a few communication-related statistics from our friends at D!straction.gov:<sup>51</sup></p>
        <ul>
          <li>As of December 2012, 171.3 billion text messages were sent in the US (includes PR, the Territories, and Guam) every month. (CTIA)</li>
          <li>Cell phone use was reported in 18% of distraction-related fatalities in America.</li>
          <li>At any given daylight moment across America, approximately 660,000 drivers are using cell phones or manipulating electronic devices while driving, a number that has held steady since 2010. (NOPUS)</li>
          <li>Engaging in visual-manual subtasks (such as reaching for a phone, dialing and texting) associated with the use of hand-held phones and other portable devices increased the risk of getting into a crash by three times. (VTTI)</li>
          <li>Five seconds is the average time your eyes are off the road while texting. When traveling at 55mph, that's enough time to cover the length of a football field blindfolded. (2009, VTTI)</li>
          <li>Headset cell phone use is not substantially safer than hand-held use. (VTTI)</li>
          <li>A quarter of teens respond to a text message once or more every time they drive. 20 percent of teens and 10 percent of parents admit that they have extended multi-message text conversations while driving. (UMTRI)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Some Conclusions about Uses of Communication Devices</strong></p>
        <p>Multiple studies have been conducted on driver performance and we consistently see the results showing abilities are lowered when he or she is involved in a phone conversation. The surprising statistic is that the use of a hands-free device actually does not substantially decrease levels of distraction. Also, the number of vehicle collisions and near-misses attributed to dialing is approximately equal to that attributed to the actual phone conversation itself. </p>
        <p>So consider, even though it may be legal to carry on a conversation using a hands-free device, that does not mean it is a safe activity in which to participate. This is another driver distraction that affects your manual and cognitive functions, so unless there is an emergency situation, minimize your use of the hands-free devices.</p>
        <p>If someone reaches out to you via phone or text while you’re driving, ignore it until you are safely parked or have safely pulled to the side of the road to respond. Otherwise, the text can wait. The conversation can wait. Plan your trips so that you’ve taken care of urgent communications prior to getting on the road. You and those driving or walking near you will be safer for it!</p>

        <h4><span>4.</span> Scenery/window shopping</h4>

        <p>Have you ever craned your neck to get a good look at an accident while you are driving passed it? Or perhaps you have been mesmerized by the beautiful coastline along Big Sur or the stunning vineyards in Napa. If you have, you have been a victim of both visual and cognitive driver distractions! </p>
        <p>The accident nearby might be massive and worthy of intensive gawking or the scenery might be absolutely breath-taking, but if you are operating a vehicle, you must resign yourself to miss out on gazing at the details. If you are like me and can’t help but look at gorgeous scenery, then you need to have a friend take over as driver while you enjoy the sights. </p>
        <p>Sometimes visual distractions are unavoidable, however. There are times when you’ll need to read road signs or street names and addresses. If a vehicle has been pulled over by local law enforcement, you may need to look at the location of the cars in order to safely maneuver around them, etc. Just keep in mind that, if your eyes are not focused on the task of driving, you are increasing your chances of being in a collision. Be mindful of the following distractions and do your best to remain alert and focused on your driving responsibilities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Accidents, whether on your side of the road or in on-coming traffic</li>
          <li>Vehicles on the side of the road, whether pulled over by the police or due to car trouble or some other emergency</li>
          <li>Constructions zones, with their captivating machines and muscle-bound construction workers</li>
          <li>Billboards and other advertisements blinding you along the way</li>
          <li>Beautiful scenic views</li>
          <li>Street names and addresses</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any and all of these things can be a dangerous, and even deadly, distraction. I am sorry to be the bearer of bad news, friends, but you’ll have to forego the enjoyment of gawking at all of these things when behind the wheel. Keep your eyes and mind focused on driving safely.</p>

        <h4><span>5.</span> Radio/music/ear buds or headphones</h4>

        <img src="../images/curriculum-clipart/clip-art-20.gif" alt="clipart of man singing while driving">
        <p>A good playlist can make even the biggest grump a little calmer when sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic. But hearing your favorite jam is less important than being able to hear what is happening on the road. Hearing is an underrated asset when discussing safe driving practices. Consider how the honking of a horn, the screeching of tires or the sirens of an emergency vehicle might alter how behavior or response when behind the wheel. If a vehicle is in your blind spot, your hearing becomes a key component of safety. The driver may honk to alert you of his or her presence in an attempt to prevent you from completing your merge into their lane. If you are unable to hear any of these alerts, you are less likely to benefit from their warning and more likely to suffer the consequences of a collision. </p>
        <p>Even if your hearing is perfect, load music blaring through your speakers will render you deaf to the world outside of your car. If you are wearing headphones or ear buds, you’re even more likely to miss the warning sounds. It is actually against the law to wear ear phones or ear buds in <strong>both</strong> ears. Even though you are legally allowed to wear one, we would encourage you to rethink this. Even one ear blocked can diminish your ability to distinguish sounds and wear they originate, which then diminishes the effectiveness of the warning. And really, wouldn’t the sound be better coming to both ears from your speakers? </p>
        <p>Aside from the dangers of being unable to hear well, listening to music in your car can also pose the threat of <strong>manual, visual</strong> and <strong>cognitive</strong> distractions. Simply changing radio stations, skipping a song on a cd or mp3 player, or adjusting the sound system all require your hands, eyes and concentration. Implement the best practice of adjusting your vehicle’s sound controls before you begin your drive. Avoid playing ADD DJ, where you constantly flip between radio stations or playlists. Pick a station or a playlist that you will enjoy for the duration of your journey and leave it there. Or if you have a passenger in the car, allow him or her to handle the music responsibilities. </p>

        <h4><span>6.</span> Passengers (including children/pets)</h4>

        <p>Passengers can be a blessing or a curse. That person sitting next to you can man the responsibilities of navigator, DJ, address-scouter, dog whisperer, baby monitor, etc. All of these possibilities make the life of the driver much more manageable. But if that passenger happens to be a screaming, car-sick toddler, or an unrestrained and rambunctious pet, those passengers can put all of you in grave danger.</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <img src="../images/curriculum-images/21-ix_a_6.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Image of dog hangin out a car window">
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Therefore it is in the best interest of all parties for you to do as much planning ahead as is possible. If you know your child gets carsick, make sure they have a bag within easy reach. If they get cranky and restless in the car, be sure to pack games and entertainment, snacks, videos and anything else that will be useful for holding their attention. It is important to teach your children that driving is very important and requires your full attention. Have conversations with them before you get into the car to remind them that you have to focus and they need to entertain themselves while on the road. Consider implementing a reward system whereby they receive a sticker or treat or toy if they are able to refrain from distracting you while driving.</p>
        <p>Of course there will be urgent matters with young children that do require your attention. For those times, be sure to pull over to a parking lot or other safe spot and put your hazard lights on before attempting to turn your attention to your children. Do not try to address the situation while also attempting to continue driving. If you happen to be driving on a freeway, it is actually illegal to pull over to tend to your children or to make or receive a non-emergency call. Therefore in these cases, you must exit the freeway in order to pull over or park before tending to your children. Just remember – their lives are in your hands when you are behind the wheel. A little cut or a stuck finger is less urgent than ensuring the safety of their very lives by paying attention to the road. You should always pull over to a safe spot to handle the kids.</p>
        <p>If your adult passenger happens to be a boyfriend, girlfriend or spouse, they might pose another set of distractions. Let’s just say a moving vehicle is no place to try to spice up your love life! This particular distraction will involve all three types – manual, visual and definitely cognitive! Love has a way of turning off your brain, so do everyone a favor and tell your loved one to keep his or her hands (and all other body parts!) to him or herself until you have safely pulled over.</p>
        <p>Another hazardous passenger is the sweet family pet. If they are loose in your vehicle, chances are good that they might distract you, either by falling and/or injuring themselves, or by trying to get in your lap. Never allow your pet to sit in your lap! Not only is this a cognitive, manual and oftentimes a visual distraction, but if you were to get into a collision, your beloved pet could be seriously injured or killed by the deployment of the airbag.</p>
        <p>Small dogs and cats have also been known to burrow near the feet of the driver, which is extremely dangerous. Not only could they be injured if they are near the brake pedal when you need to stop urgently, but they could also find their way under that pedal and prevent you from being able to brake as needed. Also, if you do get into a collision, there is nothing to prevent your pet from being thrown from the car or through the glass. Pets are likely to be severely injured and/or killed when loose in the car during a collision. They could also decapitate or otherwise injure another passenger if your pet happens to be thrown forward unrestrained.</p>
        <p>Additionally, there are any number of scenarios that could put your pet in danger, even if they manage to come out of the accident injury-free. For example, a friend of mine was once the middle car in a 3-car pile-up. Her large dog had been unrestrained and thrown forward into the front seat during the collision. Thankfully she had no visible cuts or broken bones. As the driver attempted to open the driver’s side door to get out of the car, the dog was in a panic and bolted from the car. She sprinted along a very busy freeway for about half of a mile before finally stopping and allowing her owner to catch up to her. Her sheer panic could have brought her death while running in traffic, even though she did manage to survive the accident.</p>
        <p>There are plenty of safe and affordable pet restraints on the market these days. It is for your safety and theirs to invest in a pet harness, other restraining device, pet carrier or portable kennel while they are passengers in a moving vehicle.</p>

        <h4><span>7.</span> Other vehicles/hazards</h4>

        <p>Once again, the driver’s seat of a vehicle is not the place to show off your multi-tasking abilities. Driving already requires multi-tasking – your hands are directing the car, your feet are controlling the speed, your eyes are ever scanning your surroundings, your brain is calculating spacial relationships, anticipating the moves of other drivers, predicting dangers, planning for potential evasive action, etc., etc.. Does that sound like a lot to handle? Well that’s because it is! Driving is a task in which you must be fully engaged at all times. It is not down time to be used for catching up on work or the news or finally writing that hit screenplay.</p>
        <img src="../images/curriculum-clipart/clip-art-43.jpg" alt="clipart of women multi-tasking while driving">
        <p>Here are a few things you should <strong>never do</strong> while driving:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reading –</strong> Whether it is a book, a map or a newspaper, reading is not a task to complete while behind the wheel. </li>
          <li><strong>Working –</strong> Your car is not an extension of your office. It is the method of getting to and from your destinations. Do not plan on using your drive time to catch up on emails, make business calls, make notes on reports and analyses, or prepare for a meeting. </li>
          <li><strong>Smoking –</strong> If you are a smoker, plan your cigarettes around your driving time, not during. Smoking is another task that involves the big three - manual, visual and cognitive distractions. You would have to use one or both hands to remove a cigarette from its carton, light it, take puffs, etc. Your eyes and mind are also engaged in these tasks. And don’t forget the possible danger of falling ashes! It is also important to note that smoking with a minor in the vehicle is actually illegal, per The Health and Safety Code Section 118948(a), whether or not the car is in motion.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Another potentially dangerous distraction is the adjustment of various controls and knobs in your vehicle. Take the time to double-check all of your settings and controls before you begin your journey, particularly if you share a vehicle. Make sure all of your mirrors give you good visibility, that your chair is comfortable and set so that you are alert, not relaxed. Set your temperature controls ahead of time and enter in addresses to any GPS or other navigating device. If you do need to make adjustments once you’re on the road, delay the adjustments until you come to a stop or ask an available passenger to make the changes for you. </p>
        <p>In summary, the best driver is an undistracted driver. It’s important to take all of these hazards very seriously. Do not operate with the mindset that “it can’t happen to me” because it most certainly can. Place a higher value on safety for your own sake, as well as for your loved ones and the sake of the greater community.</p>
