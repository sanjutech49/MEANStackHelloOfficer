        <h3><span>A.</span> KNOWING WHEN NOT TO DRIVE</h3>

        <p>A good driver knows when to get behind the wheel and when not to.  Different factors should be taken into account when making this decision.  Remember that the decision to drive a vehicle is an important one, full of risks and factors that need to be taken into consideration.  Here are some things to consider before you get on the road.</p>

        <h4><span>1.</span> Personal concerns</h4>

        <h5><span>i.</span>Fatigue</h5>

        <img src="../images/curriculum-clipart/clip-art-10.gif" alt="Image of a sleepy person driving">

        <p>A tired driver is a much less alert driver. Because our natural biological clock is set to sleep at night, most drivers find that their ability to be alert declines at night, particularly after midnight. Reaction times to driving hazards decline drastically when you are fatigued, and therefore you may be more vulnerable to collisions.</p>

        <p>Here are some tips to stay alert during long driving trips:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Certain prescription and over the counter medications can make you drowsy.  Make sure you read the labels for any medications you take before driving.</li>
          <li>Try not to set out on a long trip in the late evening.</li>
          <li>Get a good night's sleep before beginning a long driving trip.  Sleeping for 7-9 hours is ideal, depending on individual need.  Some need more sleep while some can operate on a little less, but 7-9 is a good starting point.</li>
          <li>Once in a while, roll down your windows.  This will let in fresh air and help you keep alert.</li>
          <li>Whether or not you feel fatigued, take regular stops to freshen up, use the restroom, move around, splash water on your face and take a rest.</li>
          <li>You can keep yourself alert by listening to music, or radio, or keeping candy or gum in your mouth. </li>
          <li>Diversify the direction of your stare, and shift periodically. Refocus on objects of various distances and locations to keep yourself fresh.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Ideally you should drive with a companion and alternate drivers when one gets tired.  Don’t be a hero – if you’re tired, pull over and let the other person drive. </p>

        <h5><span>ii.</span>Feeling overly emotional</h5>

        <p>Our emotions often get the best of us.  It is very important to be aware of your own emotions before you get behind the wheel of a car.  Emotions can impair judgment just the same way as alcohol or drugs. People who are in an angry state while driving can be dangerous to themselves and other drivers.  <strong class="bonus-phrases"> Sasha sits like a sphinx.</strong></p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h5><span>iii.</span>Inability to focus on driving</h5>

        <p>While you drive, keep your attention on the road instead of in your thoughts.  Some people check out while they are driving and think about other things. This causes them to be much less alert to the road and have slowed down reaction times.</p>

        <p>If you find that you are unable to focus on driving it is best to let someone else drive, or pull over and wait until you feel ready.  Many find it helpful to talk to someone about whatever issue is clouding their thoughts in order to help refocus.</p>

        <h5><span>iv.</span>Poor vision</h5>

        <p>If you are unable to see optimally, you will not be able to properly determine distances or find hazards, and your judgment will be impaired.  Good vision is instrumental in good driving Equally important is your peripheral vision.  Peripheral vision is the vision that you have out of the corner of your eyes. When your eyes are on the road in front of you, it helps to spot cars, pedestrians and other objects that show up next to you.</p>

        <p>Some may be able to see clearly in the day, but need glasses to see best at night or on cloudy days.  When there is a glare it is also difficult to see. A driver needs to be able to judge distance with accuracy.  Many drivers that have 20/20 vision still may not have the ability to judge for distance. </p>

        <p>The best thing for a driver to do is to get regular eye check-ups.  Checkups can ensure that your vision is good, for both your regular and peripheral vision, and that you are able to judge distance well.  If need be, a checkup can determine that you need glasses, or that you need new prescriptions if you already wear glasses.</p>

        <img src="../images/curriculum-clipart/clip-art-11.gif" alt="Image of an eye doctor with a patient">

        <h5><span>v.</span>Medicated/alcohol level</h5>

        <p>Many prescription medications can cause drowsiness and impair your judgment while you are driving.  Some examples of medications that can cause driving impairment are sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics, and amphetamines.  Prescription medications are typically marked with a warning on their labels regarding causing drowsiness.  Make sure you read all labels on your prescriptions before taking your medication and driving.  </p>

        <p>Many over-the-counter medications for colds, flus and allergies can cause drowsiness, impair your judgment and slow down reaction times.  Read labels carefully or consult with a pharmacist or doctor before taking any of these medications in advance of driving.   If you take a medication that affects your driving ability without realizing it or by some careless mistake, you are still accountable for your driving and will be held responsible for your driving actions. </p>

        <p>Make sure that before you drive you do not do any of the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Mix different medications </li>
          <li>Take a medication that has not been prescribed to you</li>
          <li>Mix medications with alcohol (prescribed or over-the-counter)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><span>2.</span> Exterior concerns</h4>

        <h5><span>i.</span>Conditions are beyond driving ability (self-regulating driver)</h5>

        <p>“Self-regulating” refers to behaviors older drivers adapt to in order to compensate for their changing capacities. It is best described as follows:</p>

        <p>It is generally assumed that older drivers ‘self-regulate’ their driving behaviour to minimise their risk of crashing. Self-regulation implies that drivers make adjustments in their driving behaviour that adequately match changing cognitive, sensory and motor capacities. Examples of such behaviours include reduction in driving distance and avoidance of busy traffic and night driving.</p>

        <p>The good news is it seems that these behaviors do adequately compensate for decline related to age. So let’s take a look at some of the potential issues with these changing capacities and some tips to maximize safety.</p>

        <h4><strong>Safety Tips for Mature Drivers</strong></h4>

        <ul>
          <li>Misreading signs on the road</li>
          <li>Getting confused on busy streets and busy intersections</li>
          <li>Changes in vision</li>
          <li>Changes in concentration </li>
          <li>Changes in reaction times and motor capacities</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Here are some tips for older drivers to maximize safety:</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>Check your eyes on an annual basis to make sure there have been no changes in your vision.  If you feel that your vision is less clear, get a check- up as soon as possible.</li>
          <li>If bright lights are a problem, avoid driving at night.</li>
          <li>Try to avoid driving in poor weather.</li>
          <li>Avoid driving at night if your vision is not optimal.  </li>
          <li>Try to drive on roads that you know well and avoid trying new routes, if at all possible.</li>
          <li>Take your car in for regular maintenance, such as oil changes, checking of headlamps and tires, etc.</li>
          <li>Wear your seat belt at all times.  Remember that collisions can be more deadly for older drivers due to possible osteoporosis and other health-related issues.  </li>
          <li>Drive at the posted speed limit and not much slower than that.  Driving too slowly can be hazardous, too. </li>
        </ul>

        <h5><span>ii.</span>Vehicle meeting requirements</h5>

        <p>It is against the law to drive a vehicle that is in an unsafe condition.  If the vehicle is not properly maintained, or presents a safety hazard in any way, you may not drive the vehicle.  If the vehicle has not passed its smog test and is not properly certified, you may not drive it.</p>

        <p>Have your vehicle regularly checked for flat tires, engine concerns, and seatbelt functionality are all in working order. Also check that the head and taillights, and emergency lights are all properly working. We’ll discuss these vehicle requirements more in depth in Section X of this course.</p>

        <h5><span>iii.</span>Driver license/vehicle registration/liability insurance is not valid or current</h5>

        <ul>
          <li>You may not drive with an expired or suspended driver’s license.  If you have never obtained a driver’s license, you may not drive a vehicle.</li>
          <li>Make sure your vehicle registration is current and that you have your up-to-date month and year stickers on your plates.  </li>
          <li>Make certain that you have current and adequate auto insurance coverage.  It is unlawful in the state of California to drive without insurance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><span>B.</span> COMMUNICATION</h3>

        <p>While driving, just like in your social life, you need to communicate what your intentions are and if there is anything wrong. Consider yourself in a relationship with other drivers.  If you do not communicate, the relationship falls apart.  Here are some forms of communication with your vehicle to other drivers:</p>

        <p><strong>Signaling</strong></p>

        <p>These are some of the times to always use your signal:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Turning left or right</li>
          <li>Changing lanes</li>
          <li>Slowing down </li>
          <li>Stopping </li>
          <li>Upon seeing hazards on the road or if you have any malfunctions in your car</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <img src="../images/curriculum-images/57-iii_b.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Image of the bicycle lane on the road">
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Signals can done by hand or with your car’s signal lights.  For turns or lane changes, a signal must be given by your vehicle’s signal lights, unless the vehicle is not equipped with signal lamps, such as in the case of vehicles made before January 1, 1958.  Hand and arm signals can be used together with signal lights on your vehicle if need be.  Hand and arm signals alone without signal lights can be used only if the signal lights on your vehicle have become temporarily disabled.  The law requires that signal lights be used when signaling is required if they are operative. </p>

        <p>If you should need to signal by arm, follow these guidelines:</p>

        <img src="../images/curriculum-images/61-iii_b-2.jpg" alt="Image of hand signals">
        <p>
            All required hand and arm signals must be given from the left side of your vehicle as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Left turn: hand and arm extended horizontally beyond the side of the vehicle</li>
          <li>Right turn: hand and arm extended upward beyond the side of the vehicle, except that a bicyclist may extend the right hand and arm horizontally to the right side of the bicycle</li>
          <li>Stop or sudden decrease of speed: hand and arm extended downward beyond the side of the vehicle</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here are some guidelines for when you should be signaling:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Indicate your intentions at least five seconds before you change lanes on a freeway.</li>
          <li>When you are within 100 feet of the place where you want to turn left or right, activate your turn signal. Make sure, of course, that there are no other vehicles or pedestrians passing through or blocking your turn and that the lane into which you are turning is clear.</li>
          <li>Every time you change lanes, you must signal beforehand.  Make sure the lane you want to change into is clear by checking your mirrors, looking over your shoulder, and checking your blind spots before doing so.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <img src="../images/curriculum-images/13-iii_b.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Image of a road">
          </div>
        </div>

        <ul>
          <li>Always signal before pulling next to the curb or away from the curb.</li>
          <li>Each and every time that you change directions, you must alert those around you.</li>
          <li>If your intentions are to turn beyond an intersection, commence signaling when you are actually in the intersection. If you activate your turn signal before entering the intersection, you will be communicating to others that you intend to turn at the intersection and may cause confusion and/or a collision.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Always remember to turn off your signal after you have completed your turn.  This allows other drivers the courtesy of knowing that you are done changing lanes and that they can proceed next to you or change lanes if they need to.</p>

        <h4><strong>Using Your Horn</strong></h4>

        <p>This is a good way to communicate with other drivers.  There are times when it is appropriate to use your horn and times when it is not – take a look at the lists below to know the difference!</p>

        <h4><strong>When Honking the Horn is Appropriate</strong></h4>

        <img src="../images/curriculum-clipart/clip-art-17.gif" alt="Image of a lady honking her horn while driving">

        <ul>
          <li>When necessary to avoid collisions </li>
          <li>To attract the attention of another driver when necessary to prevent collisions and insure safe operation (e.g. if you’re in another driver’s blind spot and they signal to merge into your lane, honk your horn to alert them of your presence)</li>
          <li>When driving on narrow mountain roads with less than 200 feet of visibility, or any other time you are potentially sharing all or part of your lane with the oncoming traffic and have visibility of less than 200 feet</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><strong>When Honking the Horn is Inappropriate</strong></h4>

        <ul>
          <li>When you’re frustrated and angry and want to release some of your negative energy on the world</li>
          <li>When you want to bully other drivers and/or bicyclists to speed up or move over because they are driving slower than you would like to go; just remember you don’t know the state of the person riding in front of you – they could be ill, lost, experiencing mechanical failures, etc., so give them the benefit of the doubt and exercise a little patience </li>
          <li>When you want to be sure the other driver knows they made a mistake and/or was rude to you – this could be the last straw for an angry person teetering on road rage or it could completely unnerve a distressed driver and cause them to make even more mistakes</li>
          <li>To get the attention of anyone around you, including pedestrians, motorcyclists, bicyclists, etc., for any reason other than preventing a collision</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>It is important to note that horns sound louder to others outside your car than they sound to you.  This means that you could scare other drivers with your horn and can actually cause accidents instead of prevent them.  A good alternative to honking is stopping or slowing down.  Remember to keep your emotions under wraps when driving and using your horn.</strong></p>

        <h4>
          <strong>Hazard Lights</strong>
        </h4>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
              <img src="../images/curriculum-images/62-iii_b-3.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Image of a road">
            </div>
          </div>

        <p>When pressed, the button pictured above will activate the hazard lights on your vehicle.  Hazard lights are a pair of flashing lights.  They are used to warn other drivers behind you of a collision ahead so that they may slow down and be on their guard well in advance, thereby avoiding more collisions.  Use these emergency flashers and brake as slowly as is safe for the conditions, tapping the brakes a few times.  You can do this in conjunction with the hand signal for slowing/stopping for more effective visibility.  Hazard lights can also be used when you encounter a problem while driving and you need to pull over or slow down.  They communicate with other drivers that your vehicle is in distress.</p>

        <p>When you are experiencing car troubles, you can use your flashing emergency signals.  If you experience vehicle problems, there are a few important rules you should follow before stopping your vehicle.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Slowly and mindfully pull off the road without disturbing traffic.  This may not always be possible, but if it is, this method is ideal.</li>
          <li>If it is not possible to pull off the road completely, make sure you stop somewhere other drivers can fully see you from behind and that you are fully within view. Please make sure you don’t stop at the bottom of a hill.  Drivers will not be able to predict you are there and this may cause a collision.  Do not park at the end of a curve in the road, as this is also a blind area for other drivers and they may not see you until it is too late.</li>
          <li>If you are completely stopped, use your emergency flashing lights.  A substitution for emergency flashers in case your vehicle doesn’t have any or they are not working properly is to use your turn signals. Raising your hood could also be a substitute to let people know your vehicle is in distress.</li>
          <li>If you have emergency flares or cones, place them 200-300 feet behind your vehicle.  This will warn other drivers that you are stopped ahead.  It will allow other drivers time to change lanes to avoid hitting you. Do not use flares where they may cause a fire. This is dangerous.</li>
          <li>Keep your emergency lights on and stay in your vehicle until help arrives. </li>
          <li>Never change your tire on the road.  Make sure you have pulled of the road completely before attempting to do this.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><span>C.</span> BEING COURTEOUS</h3>

        <img src="../images/curriculum-clipart/clip-art-18.jpg" alt="Image of a well dressed gentleman bowing while taking his hat off">

        <p>Being courteous on the road means a few different things.  Let’s take a look at some of the ways drivers can show basic courtesy:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Don’t cut people off.  Sudden decisions and last-minute moves to slip into another lane or to exit the freeway are examples.  Usually in these situations turn signals are not used, and distances are not gauged properly.  This puts the other driver in a bad position of having to react quickly to avoid running into you or otherwise having an accident.  This is just plain rude and reckless.</li>
          <li>Allow room for drivers when they signal that they want to pull in front of you; don’t speed up. If someone lets you in, give them a gesture of gratitude such as a wave to let them know you appreciate their kindness.</li>
          <li>Keep your emotions under control.  Road Rage has become a serious problem nationwide and is implicated in many auto accidents and incidents on the road.  (See Section VIII for some startling statistics!)  Keep your cool even when you feel pushed to the limit by a stressful day, sitting in traffic or another driver’s bad attitudes toward you. </li>
          <li>Do not tailgate.  This is unsafe and reckless.  Follow the driver in front of you with a safe distance.  Always use the 3-second rule when following another vehicle.  The 3-second rule will be covered in more detail in Chapter 6.</li>
          <li>Meanwhile if you are the one being tailgated, the best action for you to take is not to brake, or try to send signals to the rude person behind you.  The best thing to do is to pull over or change lanes and allow the tailgater to pass. Basically, just be the bigger person.</li>
          <li>Always use your turn signals to let other drivers know what you are planning to do so they can plan accordingly.  Letting other drivers know your intentions by signaling communicates a sense of respect and courtesy on the road.  Signaling helps other drivers know what to expect and plan out what they are going to do as well, either slowing down, or shifting over to the left lane to safely pass. Signaling is an important form of communication on the road. It is rude to change lanes without signaling – and not only is it rude, it is dangerous.  Drivers behind you will not be able to predict your behavior and not only can this cause negative emotions in them, but it can also cause a collision!  Using your signals shows that you are aware of and courteous to other drivers on the road with you.  You are not the only vehicle on the road.  We all have to share the road.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><span>D.</span> KNOWING AND CORRECTLY APPLYING RULES OF THE ROAD</h3>

        <p>As the operator of your vehicle, you are responsible for knowing and following all pertinent rules of the road.  This means knowing the rules as well as knowing how to apply the rules.  The following are rules that you will be expected to know.</p>

        <h4><strong>RIGHT-OF-WAY RULES</strong></h4>

        <p>Respecting the right of way of pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, and other vehicles will help to promote traffic safety and prevent collisions.  Also you must remember not to ever assume other drivers will give you the right-of-way.  Right of way violations can cause serious collisions and in fact do cause a high percentage of injury of collisions in California. </p>

        <p>Let us look closely at right of way laws as they pertain to various driving situations.</p>

        <h4><strong>Pedestrians</strong></h4>

        <p>All vehicles must make their best effort to stop for a pedestrian proceeding to cross the street, whether or not the pedestrian has the legal right of way.  Always stop for any pedestrian crossing at corners or any marked crosswalks or unmarked crosswalks at intersections, regardless of how inconvenient it is for you.</p>

        <h4><strong>Crosswalks</strong></h4>

        <p>A crosswalk is the section of the street typically allocated for pedestrian use and enables them to cross the street safely. Most intersections have a pedestrian crosswalk with painted lines, and some have crosswalks without painted lines.  Crosswalks are located at corners and can even be located in the middle of the block.   Pedestrians always have the right of way at crosswalks whether or not they are painted, so before crossing one or turning on a corner make sure to yield to any pedestrians. </p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <img src="../images/curriculum-images/14-iii_d.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Image of a street crosswalk">
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Crosswalks are usually painted with white lines. At school crossings they are usually painted yellow.   In residential areas, crosswalks are not painted with lines. They may are may not be equipped with flashing lights, so always look for pedestrians no matter what.</p>

        <h4><strong>Intersections</strong></h4>

        <p>An intersection is the point at which one line of road meets another road. Some examples of intersections include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Cross streets</li>
          <li>Side streets </li>
          <li>Alleys</li>
          <li>Freeway entrances</li>
          <li>Any location where vehicles traveling on different highways or roads intersect.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Driving through intersections can be tricky and complicated and require extra care.   It may surprise you to know that according to the Federal Highway Administration, 45 percent of all collisions are accounted for by intersection collisions.  They also account for  21 percent of collision fatalities.  You can see why it is most important to proceed with utmost caution at intersections.</p>

        <p>Here are some important points to follow at intersections:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>At intersections without "STOP" or "YIELD" signs always slow down and be ready to stop.</li>
          <li>Always yield to traffic and pedestrians that were there before you or just entering the intersection.</li>
          <li>Yield to the vehicle or bicycle that arrives first</li>
          <li>Yield to the vehicle or bicycle on your right if it reaches the intersection at  the same time as you.</li>
          <li>At "T" intersections that do not have "STOP" or "YIELD" signs, yield to traffic and pedestrians that are on the through road because have the right-of-way.</li>
          <li>When turning left always give the right-of-way to all vehicles approaching close enough to be dangerous.</li>
          <li>Always look for motorcyclists, bicyclists, and pedestrians.</li>
          <li>Keep your wheels pointed straight ahead when you wait to turn left.  Turn your wheels only when you are ready to move and proceed.  The reason for this is if your wheels are pointed to the left, and you are hit from behind, this could roll you into oncoming traffic.</li>
          <li>On right turns make sure there are no pedestrians crossing the street or  bicyclists coming up behind you on the right.</li>
          <li>If you are driving on divided highways or highways with multiple lanes, be especially aware of vehicles coming in any lane you cross. Make sure it is safe before you turn right.</li>
          <li>"STOP" signs at all corners mean you come to a full stop first then follow the rules listed above.</li>
          <li>When leaving a parking lot, yield to traffic before reentering the road.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><strong>Roundabouts</strong></h4>

        <p>Roundabouts are intersections where traffic traverses around a middle island in a counter-clockwise direction.  Roundabouts are not exempt to right of way laws and therefore all vehicles entering or leaving the roundabout should yield to all traffic including pedestrians.</p>

        <p>Let’s go over a few important rules of roundabouts:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Yield to pedestrians and bicyclists crossing the roadway.</li>
          <li>Always slow down as you approach the roundabout.</li>
          <li>Watch for signs and markings and decipher what they are communicating.</li>
          <li>Wait for a large enough gap in traffic before entering the roundabout.</li>
          <li>Always drive in a counter-clockwise direction in a roundabout.</li>
          <li>Do not stop or pass other vehicles while driving in a roundabout.</li>
          <li>Make sure to utilize your signals when you change lanes or exit the roundabout.</li>
          <li>If you miss your exit, complete the roundabout again untill you find to your exit again.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><strong>Multiple and single lane roundabout</strong></h4>

        <p>Some roundabouts have one lane only, and some have multiple lanes.  For roundabouts with multiple lanes you must choose your entry lane depending on where you are planning to go and where you are planning to exit.  Here are some pointers:  </p>

        <ul>
          <li>If you are planning to turn right at the intersection choose the right-hand lane and exit in the right-hand lane.</li>
          <li>In order to go straight through the intersection choose any lane, and exit in the lane you entered.</li>
          <li>In order to turn left choose the left lane, and exit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><strong>Driving on Mountain Roads</strong></h4>

        <p>Mountain roads can be treacherous, thin and windy. There are times when the road is not wide enough for two vehicles to pass each other or to have their own lanes.  For this reason it is especially important to watch for other vehicles.</p>

        <div class="row">

            <img src="../images/curriculum-images/15-iii_d_.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="An image of a wide road">
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>In a situation where two vehicles meet head-on on a road that is steep and can’t pass each other the rule is that the vehicle facing downhill must yield the right of way.  The vehicle facing downhill should back up until the vehicle going uphill can pass safely. This is because any vehicle facing downhill will have greater control in this situation.</p>

        <h4><strong>The wonderful world of SPEED LIMITS</strong></h4>

        <p>There is one basic speed law in California that is very important to know: </p>

        <p><strong>California’s Basic Speed Law:</strong>Drive at a speed that is safe for current conditions.  The posted speed limit is not a sufficient enough guide to how fast you can drive.  If the speed limit is too fast for the given conditions and you follow it, you may be cited and more importantly be placing other people in harm’s way. </p>

        <p>Pay attention to the road.  Your speed must be dictated by the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>How many vehicles are on the road and what is their speed.</li>
          <li>The condition of the road’s surface: rough, icy, stony or smooth.</li>
          <li>Whether or not there are bicyclists or pedestrians present and how many of them there are.</li>
          <li>Weather conditions such as storm, rain, snow, fog, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <img src="../images/curriculum-images/16-iii_d_.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Image of a two lane road wit a 30mph speed limit sign">
          </div>
        </div>

        <h4><strong>Maximum speed limit rules in California are as follows:</strong></h4>

        <ul>
          <li>Typically, maximum speed limit on California highways is 65 mph. </li>
          <li>There are some highways on which you can go as fast as a posted speed limit of 70 miles per hour.</li>
          <li>As a rule, the maximum speed limit on two-lane undivided highways is 55 miles per hour, unless of course a different speed limit is posted.</li>
          <li>Speed limits are typically reduced in Construction zones.</li>
          <li>Always pay attention to posted signs and speed limits in the areas in which you are driving.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Please be advised that driving faster than the posted speed limit is illegal and unsafe.  You will be pulled over and cited.  Speeding is dangerous and reckless.  The faster you go, the more time you need to stop your vehicle in case of a hazard ahead.  At faster speeds the force of impact during a collision is much more deadly than at lower speeds. </p>

        <h4><strong>Minimum Speed Limits:</strong></h4>

        <p>It is possible to get pulled over and ticketed for driving too slowly.  It is ok to slow your vehicle if it is for the purpose of safety or as indicated by law.  However, if your speed is too slow and somehow impeding or blocking the smooth flow of traffic, you may be cited.  You may also not stop your vehicle in the middle of the highway unless there is a very good safety or legal reason for which you are stopping.</p>


        <h4><strong><em>When should you reduce your speed?</em></strong></h4>

        <h4><strong>Always reduce your speed under the following conditions:</strong></h4>

        <h4><strong>Difficult weather conditions:</strong></h4>

        <p>Always try to go with the flow of traffic during bad weather.  Driving too fast or too slow can both be unsafe.  Generally when weather conditions are bad, such as in rain, snow, hail, and fog, all vehicles must slow down in order to avoid accidents.</p>

        <h4><strong>Traffic:</strong></h4>

        <p>If there is heavy traffic you must slow down your vehicle.  If traffic is light, go with the flow of traffic and drive at about the same speed as other cars.  Always heed posted speed limits and assess for road conditions when choosing a speed limit.</p>

        <h4><strong>Towing Vehicles and Large Vehicles:</strong></h4>

        <p>The maximum speed for the following vehicles on a highway is not allowed to exceed 55 miles per hour:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A motortruck or truck tractor that has three or more axles</li>
          <li>Any motortruck or truck tractor drawing any other vehicle</li>
          <li>Any passenger vehicle or bus drawing any other vehicle</li>
          <li>A school bus transporting any students</li>
          <li>A farm labor vehicle transporting passengers</li>
          <li>A vehicle transporting explosives</li>
          <li>Any trailer bus</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Anyone who operates a commercial motor vehicle or holds a commercial driver’s license and who is found to exceed this important legal speed limit by 15 mph or more will be found guilty of a misdemeanor or an infraction.</p>
        <p>Any of the above referenced vehicles must be driven in the lane or lanes as designated by the local authorities and made known via posted signs. In the absence of designated lanes, these vehicles must use the right-hand lane. On divided highways with 4 or more traffic lanes in one direction, these vehicles may travel in the right-hand lane and the lane to the immediate left of the right-hand lane. These restrictions do not apply where otherwise prohibited or to drivers who are preparing for turns or are entering/exiting a highway.</p>

        <h4><strong>Around Children:</strong></h4>

        <p>Any time you drive within 500-1000 feet of a school or any establishment where there are children present outside (parks, playgrounds, recreation centers)  or may be crossing the street, follow a speed limit of max 25 miles per hour.  Certain school zones have a posted speed limit of 15miles per hour.  This is because a child may not know or be able to follow normal pedestrian rules, may jump out in front of your car while playing or attempting to cross the street.  You need as much time to react to their unpredictable nature as possible.</p>

        <h4><strong>Here are some situations where you must stop when around schools or other institutions where children might be present:</strong></h4>

        <ul>
          <li>Bicyclists and pedestrians crossing the street. </li>
          <li>Obey crossing guard directions and always allow crossing guards to safely do their job.</li>
          <li>Stopped school buses: When the bus flashes red lights and displays the stop signal arm, if equipped with the stop signal arm, you must come to a complete stop and wait to proceed until the red lights are off and the stop signal arm has been retracted. Be careful to check that all children have all crossed the street. You may proceed without stopping only if the school bus is stopped on the opposite side of a divided or multi-lane highway.  Please note that school bus drivers are able to report you by taking down your license plate number and providing a description of the time and place where you violated this law.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><strong>Blind intersections:</strong></h4>

        <p>Typically the speed limit for blind intersections is 15 miles per hour.  First let us take a look at exactly what Blind Intersection means.  A blind intersection is an intersection where there are no stop signs at any corner and you are not able to see 100 feet in either direction during the last 100 feet before you are able to cross the intersection.  Many things can block your view to the side.  Proceed forward very slowly making sure the coast is clear before you cross.</p>

        <h4><strong>Near Railroad Tracks:</strong></h4>

        <p>As a rule the speed limit within 100 feet of a railroad crossing is 15 miles per hour.  This is if you are unable to see the tracks for 400 feet in both directions. However note that you are allowed to drive faster than 15 miles per hour near a railroad track if the crossing has a human flagman on duty or a clearly visible electrical or mechanical railway crossing signal device installed but does not then indicate the immediate approach of a railway train or car.</p>

        <h4><strong>Alleys:</strong></h4>

        <p>The speed limit in an alley is typically 15 miles per hour.  This is because alleys are rather bumpy, narrow, and any number of unpredictable things can occur in an alley such as trucks and delivery vehicles traversing, pedestrians and workers crossing, parked cars moving, etc.  Always be cautious when driving in an alley.</p>

        <h4><strong>Light Rail Transit Vehicle Crossings:</strong></h4>

        <p>Here we follow exactly the same rules as freight train crossings.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Do not proceed across the tracks until you can see clearly in both directions</li>
          <li>Do not proceed across the tracks unless you are sure no light rail transit vehicles or trains coming.</li>
          <li>Stop at any gate that is lowered and never go around or under lowered gates.</li>
          <li>Please be warned: these vehicles are smaller and quieter than large freight trains.  They are easier to miss.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><strong>Streetcars/Trolleys/Buses:</strong></h4>

        <p> At intersections where a streetcar, bus or trolley is stopped, there will be a marked safety zone. At such intersections there might by police officers or traffic signals that control it.  Safety zones are set aside for pedestrians.</p>

        <h4><strong>Business or Residential Districts:</strong></h4>

        <p>In these districts, the speed limit is typically 25 miles per hour unless otherwise clearly stated on a sign.</p>

        <h4><strong>Around Animals:</strong></h4>

        <p>On mountain roads or woodsy areas you might see signs that signal certain animals live there and you may encounter one.  These signs typically mean that you should be on the lookout and slow down a bit to give yourself more room for reaction time. </p>

        <h3><span>E.</span> IDENTIFYING AND RESPONDING TO HAZARDS</h3>

        <p>Identifying a driving hazard in time to take effective evasive action in order to avoid a collision is a very important aspect of safe driving practices. It is of utmost importance to understand how to spot and avoid hazards when driving to improve safety on the road. </p>

        <p>A hazard can be defined as any possible source of danger which could cause a collision on or near the road.  Hazards can come out of nowhere and surprise you and can come from any direction. Examples of a hazard are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Children running into the road</li>
          <li>Bicyclists coming into your lane without warning</li>
          <li>Parked car door opening suddenly</li>
          <li>Another vehicle coming into your lane without warning</li>
          <li>Another vehicle stopping very suddenly in front of you</li>
          <li>Debris on the road, such as fallen objects, tree branches, or debris from a car accident.</li>
          <li>Slippery road surface after rain</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Learning to avoid these unpredictable and often sudden hazards comes with careful driving and experience, and an ability to scan the road effectively.  An experienced and attentive driver will start to be able to predict a potentially dangerous situation or see it developing and avoid it. This early detection allows for more time to make a good decision about how to approach the driving hazard and respond to it appropriately.</p>

        <h3><span>F.</span> CHILD ENDANGERMENT</h3>

        <h4><span>1.</span> Checking around vehicle prior to entering and leaving</h4>

        <p>Before you enter your vehicle or leave any place where children may be present, you must always check to make sure there are no children around your vehicle. It is possible for a child to be playing or hiding around or even under your vehicle, so make it a habit to check the area to avoid accidentally hitting or injuring a child.</p>

        <h4><span>2.</span> Leaving young children in vehicle unattended</h4>

        <p>It is illegal to leave a child six years of age or under unattended in a motor vehicle. If you do so, you may be fined and asked to attend mandatory child safety classes. Penalties for this are more severe in case of child injury and death. Children who are 12 years or older can supervise children 6 years of age or younger if they are to be left unattended in a motor vehicle</p>

        <h5><span>i.</span>Temperature of a vehicle on a hot day</h5>

        <p>It is very dangerous to leave a child or a pet in a hot car, even if the window is cracked.  The interior temperature of a car could rise to 40-50 degrees higher than the temperature outside in less than an hour. A child or pet left in a hot car could suffer from dehydration, heat stroke, or even death.</p>

        <h5><span>ii.</span>Releasing brake/shifting to neutral</h5>

        <p>If you leave your children unattended, they might do something dangerous while not under your supervision, such as releasing the parking brake or shifting the gear to neutral.  This could cause the car to roll – then you’re in trouble and so are the kids.</p>

        <h5><span>iii.</span>Properly securing children in vehicle as well as heavy items</h5>

        <p>Make sure children are properly secured in the car and that heavy items are not at risk of falling on them.  Make sure the car is safe for your children, whether in motion or parked.  Assess all the risks before you leave children over the age of six unattended in the car.</p>

        <h3><span>G.</span> POOR DRIVING CONDITIONS (SUCH AS DOWNPOUR, SLIPPERY ROADS, ETC)</h3>

        <h4><strong>Water on the Road </strong></h4>

        <p>Hydroplaning is when your vehicle is riding only on water rather than making actual contact with the road.  This makes skidding or losing control of your vehicle very likely.  You are going to need to prevent this from happening by slowing down your vehicle any time there is water on the road.  If you go more than 30 miles per hour in rain, your vehicle could hydroplane.  Any slight change of direction or even wind could cause your vehicle to skid.  If your vehicle does happen to start hydroplaning, release the gas pedal to slow down very gradually.  If you slam on the brakes, this will only worsen the problem and likely cause your vehicle to spin.</p>

        <h4><strong>Slippery Roads </strong></h4><p>If there is any rain at all, you need to slow your vehicle down.  Roads will be slippery, especially 10-15 minutes after it has just started raining. It is particularly slippery after rain begins due to oil from other vehicles and new asphalt on the road mixing with the rain water. After it rains long and hard enough, the oils will be washed away, reducing the slippery nature of the roadways. </p>

        <p>Adjust your speed accordingly:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>On wet roads go 5-10 miles slower.</li>
          <li>On snowy roads reduce your speed by HALF.</li>
          <li>On icy roads slow your vehicle significantly.  You should be going at crawl speed.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Pay attention to road signs and follow their instructions. If there is a sign warning of reduced speed ahead, reduce your speed. There is a reason for those signs that you are not necessarily aware of. Trust them – they are there to help you!</p>

        <h4><strong>How to spot a slippery road:</strong></h4>

        <ul>
          <li>Ice usually forms under shady trees and is the last to melt.</li>
          <li>Bridges and overpasses are often icy because of the exposure to the elements on all sides of the structure.  They also hide the ice well.</li>
          <li>During the first 15 minutes of a rainstorm, the roads are the slipperiest.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><strong>What to do if you are skidding:</strong></h4>

        <ol>
          <li>Ease off the gas pedal or stop braking</li>
          <li>Turn the wheels in the direction of the skid until you regain control of the vehicle</li>
          <li>If all else fails, try to find something in your path that can help to slow or stop your   vehicle.  You could go on the shoulder of the road, or find gravel or dirt or even a bush or snowbank.  (Hopefully it won’t come to this, but it’s better than injuring others around you!)</li>
        </ol>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h4><strong>How to prevent skids:</strong></h4>

        <ol>
          <li>Drive slowly when conditions warrant it</li>
          <li>Slow down as you approach curves and intersections</li>
          <li>Do not take fast turns</li>
          <li>Do not stop quickly unless absolutely necessary to prevent a collision. Instead, "pump" the brakes to slow or stop—UNLESS they are antilock brakes.</li>
          <li>Shift to low gear going down on hills – this will decrease your need for braking and will help control your downhill speed.</li>
          <li>Avoid driving through ice patches, oily areas, and big puddles</li>
        </ol>

        <h4><strong>What to do about WET BRAKES</strong></h4>

        <p>When water gets into the drum brakes, they become less efficient and effective. When this happens, you may experience uneven or less braking, “grabbing” brakes and/or reduced control. To dry the brakes you should carefully and lightly press the gas pedal and brake pedal at the same. </p>

        <h4><strong>Snow and Rain</strong></h4>

        <p>In a heavy rainstorm or snowstorm:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>It’s possible you may not be able to see more than 100 feet ahead of your vehicle. </li>
          <li>If so, you will not be able to safely drive faster than 30 mph. </li>
          <li>You may have to stop intermittently to wipe mud or snow off of your windshield, headlights, and taillights.</li>
          <li>If you drive in snowy areas, you will need to carry the appropriate number of chains to be safe and make certain they fit your tires properly. You should learn how to put the chains on correctly <strong>beforehand</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><span>H.</span> RIGHTS AND DUTIES</h3>

        <h4><span>1.</span> Pedestrian related to traffic laws/traffic safety</h4>

        <p>One of the most important issues is pedestrian safety.  Let us first define what a pedestrian is.   A pedestrian is any person who is on foot or on any sort of carriage such as a skateboard, roller blades, wheelchair, etc., other than a bicycle. Bicyclists are not considered pedestrians.  </p>

        <p>When driving near pedestrians use extra caution because they may suddenly cross the road way in front of you.  According to the California Driver’s Handbook, almost 19 percent of all traffic deaths involve pedestrians.  Pedestrians are the most vulnerable participants of the road, as they are not protected by anything and can easily get hurt or killed.  Pay particular attention if you are operating a hybrid or electic vehicle because they are practically silent when in use, removing vital auditory alerts to nearby pedestrians. <strong class="bonus-phrases"> Bella and Sasha are black dogs.</strong>
        </p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <img src="../images/curriculum-images/52-iii_h_1.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Image of a street at a stop sign with a right turn only sign under the stop sign">
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Here are some basic rules, regulations and best practices involving the right-of-way of pedestrians:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>At a stop light or sign, do not stop your vehicle more than 5 feet from the crosswalk, unless there is an advance stop bar line.</li>
          <li>If a pedestrian makes eye contact with you, he or she is alerting you of their intention and readiness to cross the street. Yield to him or her.</li>
          <li>You legally must yield to pedestrians when they have the right-of-way. Regardless of where the crosswalk is located, whether at an intersection or marked in the middle of a block, you must stop for pedestrians crossing the road in crosswalks. If a pedestrian violates the right-of-way rules and crosses the road illegally, drivers should still stop, giving up your right-of-way,  in order to prevent the injury or death of the careless pedestrian.</li>
          <li>Do not come to a stop in a crosswalk. This will force pedestrians to walk around your vehicle, forcing them to walk outside of the designated crosswalk and placing them in danger.</li>
          <li>Always check for pedestrians before executing a turn, especially when turning left across traffic. Otherwise, you may find yourself stuck in front of oncoming traffic while waiting for a pedestrian to clear the roadway.</li>
          <li>Never drive on the sidewalk, except to cross it when entering or exiting a driveway or alley. Before you cross it, SCAN for pedestrians and yield to any that are in your vicinity.</li>
          <li>Allow pedestrians adequate time to completely cross the street. For disabled or older pedestrians, or pedestrians with young children or pets, this could mean waiting for a longer period of time. Better you are delayed by a few seconds rather than you placing the lives of others in danger.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>NOTE REGARDING BLIND PEDESTRIANS:</h4>

        <p>Blind pedestrians carrying a predominantly white cane or using a guide dog ALWAYS have the right of way. Blind pedestrians get around in the world in a different way than sighted people and the road is no exception.  They rely primarily on auditory stimuli when navigating crosswalks and foot travel. Pedestrians who are blind use the sound of your vehicle to be able to tell that it is nearby.   Be sure to stop within 5 feet of the crosswalk and operate on the assumption that they are unaware of your presence. If you drive a hybrid or electric vehicle, please know that your vehicle does not make as much noise as a regular vehicle.  You must be especially careful because pedestrians who are blind may not be able to hear you.  Here are a few tips for drivers related to blind pedestrians:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Do not honk your horn at a blind person.</li>
          <li>Do not attempt to give a blind pedestrian verbal directions. </li>
          <li>Do not prolong the wait for a blind pedestrian to cross the street. If a blind pedestrian does not intend to cross, he or she will pull in his or her cane and step away from the intersection. That is the gesture that means you may proceed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4><span>2.</span> Drivers related to pedestrians, bicycles, and motorcycles</h4>

        <p>Drivers have a responsibility to pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists.  Drivers should always do the following with regard to pedestrians in order to keep them safe:</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <img src="../images/curriculum-images/20-iii_h_2.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="Image of a car driving just as a pedestrian crossed past a car">
          </div>
        </div>

        <ul>
          <li>Yield the right of way to pedestrians crossing at an intersection or crosswalk on a "walk" signal or a green light. Give up your right of way when pedestrians violate the crosswalk signals. </li>
          <li>Yield the right of way to pedestrians who are crossing the highway within a marked or unmarked crosswalk at an intersection lacking traffic signs or signals.</li>
          <li>Never try to pass any vehicle that you can see has stopped at an intersection or crosswalk.  Always slow down to make sure that vehicle is not yielding to permit a pedestrian or bicyclist to cross the road.</li>
          <li>Yield the right of way to pedestrians when you are traversing a sidewalk at the entry of an alley or getting into a driveway.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Drivers have the following responsibilities to bicyclists and motorists:</h4>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">

          </div>
        </div>

        <ul>
          <li>Know how vulnerable bicyclists and motorists are on the road.  Cars weigh a lot more than bikes and motorcycles and could do great damage to the person who rides them.</li>
          <li>Afford bikes and motorcycles the same privileges as other vehicles on the road.</li>
          <li>Drivers making right turns should be sure to watch out for cyclists. A cyclist may be in your blind spot, a little behind and to the right of you.</li>
          <li>Drivers trying to make a left turn must take caution.  Bikes and motorcycles may be going faster than you think and, if you don’t gauge their speed accurately, you may get into a collision with them while turning left.</li>
          <li>Always allow three feet of clearance around bicyclists.  This helps them feel safe and keeps drivers at a safe distance, and it is now the law.</li>
          <li>Be aware the cyclists and motorcycles are sharing the road with you and look around for them.  They exist too. </li>
          <li>Be aware of cyclists while opening the door to your parked car.  You may intersect and hit a cyclist.</li>
