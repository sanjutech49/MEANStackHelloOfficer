        <h1 class="text--center"><span>VIII.</span> Road Rage/Aggressive Driving and Avoiding It</h1>

        <hr>

        <p>Road Rage and Aggressive Driving have increasingly become dangerous and serious problems that drivers must learn how to navigate. In order to prevent falling into these behaviors ourselves, we must first gain a better understanding of what each of these terms mean.</p>
        <p><strong>What Is Aggressive Driving?</strong></p>
        <img src="../images/curriculum-clipart/clip-art-18.gif" alt="clipart of aggressive drivers">
        <p>Most drivers are able to recognize aggressive driving when it is happening around them, but we rarely take the time to define and identify the associated behaviors. Luckily for us, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (‘NHTSA’) has come up with the following definition: “the operation of a motor vehicle in a manner that endangers or is likely to endanger persons or property.<sup>48</sup>” </p>
        <p>Some of the behaviors associated with aggressive driving that should be avoided can include the following:</p>
        <p><strong>Speeding:</strong> Speeding is not an act of concern for others or for safety. Typically speeding is a result of poor planning and/or impatience, frustration, etc... None of these motivations will lead to safer driving, but will likely lead to some of the other aggressive behaviors listed below. Work hard to allow yourself plenty of time to get to your destination so that you are not tempted to drive above the posted speed limit, putting yourself and everyone around you in danger.</p>
        <p><strong>Disregarding Traffic Signals:</strong> Yellow lights indicate a red light is forthcoming and are therefore signals to clear the intersection or slow down in preparation for a full stop if you have not yet entered the intersection. Yellow lights do not indicate that you should gun it so you can enter the intersection just before (or after!) the light turns red. Intersections are the most dangerous and complex part of your journey. Please take them seriously. It isn’t worth the risk of damaging property or worse - injuring yourself or someone else.</p>
        <p><strong>Lane blocking:</strong> Don't drive for long stints in the far left (or “passing”) lane, especially if you are unable to keep up with the flow of traffic. One of the leading causes of road rage is drivers who block traffic in the passing lane by driving slower than the flow of traffic! Stay to the right of the passing lane until you are ready to pass another vehicle. If a vehicle behind you wants to pass, either move to another lane to the right, if it is safe to do so, or slow down so that they have enough room to safely execute the maneuver. Do not attempt to prevent another driver from passing you.</p>
        <p><strong>Tailgating:</strong> It is critical that you maintain a safe distance away from the vehicle ahead of you. Not only is it unsafe to drive closer than 3-5 seconds behind vehicles, but it can also anger or frighten the driver in front of you. We live in a crazy world and you do not know who is driving around you. Many deadly traffic incidents began because one driver tailgated another. It is an aggressive and extremely dangerous move, on multiple levels, and is not worth it.</p>
        <p><strong>Signal use:</strong> Always use your turn signal in order to alert other drivers that you intend to switch lanes. You must ensure you have adequate space to change lanes before executing your maneuver. Make sure you don't cut someone off in order to switch lanes. Also, pay attention to the speed of the vehicles in the lane to which you are moving. If there is room for you to move when you look, but you then see a vehicle rapidly approaching, wait for that vehicle to pass before you complete your lane change. Otherwise, the driver may be in danger of rear-ending your car by the time you’re in your new lane. Once you’ve completed your lane change, be sure to turn your turn signal off, otherwise you may confuse and mislead the drivers around you. </p>
        <p><strong>Gestures:</strong> Making an obscene gesture at another human being is not only bad form, but is also very dangerous. Such gestures have actually led to people being beaten, stabbed and even shot. If you are on the brink of losing your temper, take deep breaths, count backward from 100, imagine a rum drink on a warm beach somewhere – do whatever it takes to calm yourself in order to avoid taking the risk of making an obscene gesture. </p>
        <p><strong>Horn use:</strong> The horn is not meant to be a tool for bullies. It is meant to prevent a collision and warn others of potential danger. If you’re behind a car at an intersection when the light first turns green, give them time to notice the light change. If it has been several seconds and they appear to be looking inside their car or at some device, a quick beep of alert will suffice. Again, you never know who’s driving in front of you and an aggressive round of pounding on your horn might be the thing that pushes him or her over the edge. </p>
        <p><strong>Headlight use:</strong> Headlights are also not meant to stock up a bully’s arsenal. Use your headlights appropriately and as required by law. Do not turn your high beams on as a method of getting back at the driver in oncoming traffic who may have neglected to turn them off. Also refrain from using the high beams as a motivation technique for slow drivers. </p>
        <p><strong>Blocking traffic:</strong> Do not block traffic. If you are unfamiliar with the neighborhood or the route you are taking, pull over and review your maps or GPS device before pulling back into traffic. If you’re looking for parking and need to drive well below the speed limit, pull over to allow others to pass you or pull to the right with your turn signal on to alert the drivers that they may pass when safe. If you see a friend walking on the sidewalk, pull out of the flow of traffic to have your conversation. Be mindful and respectful of those around you – we are all sharing this space, so don’t act as though it all belongs to you.</p>
        <p>Although opinion surveys show that drivers do rate aggressive driving as a major threat to safety, most do not identify their own actions as aggressive. So, either we’re all perfect angels, or many of us have a poor sense of self-awareness. Let’s make the assumption that it’s the latter and make a conscious and concerted effort to improve our sense of courtesy - if not for a sense of the greater good, then at least for a sense of personal safety. Also, keep in mind that driving is a cooperative effort, not a competitive one. We follow the rules of the road to ensure the safety of everyone involved, not for the sake of an individual being able to exercise his or her right of way.</p>
        <p>If you’re not motivated by contributing to the greater good or by protecting your own safety, consider this: driving sensibly saves money! By avoiding aggressive behaviors, such as speeding, frequent braking and rapidly accelerating, you can save on gas! The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that safe driving can decrease your gas mileage by 33% on the highway and 5% in the city. This translates to savings of at about $0.21 - $1.40 per gallon!

        <p>What is Road Rage?</p>
        <img src="../images/curriculum-clipart/clip-art-41.jpg" alt="clipart of aggressive drivers">
        <p>The primary difference between road rage and aggressive driving is that road rage involves an intent to do harm by using your vehicle as a weapon. Road rage is a physical assault through the means of a traffic incident and it is a criminal offense! According to the California Penal Code Section 245.(a)(1):</p>
        <blockquote><p>“Any person who commits an assault upon the person of another with a deadly weapon or instrument other than a firearm or by any means of force likely to produce great bodily injury shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for two, three, or four years, or in a county jail for not exceeding one year, or by a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or by both the fine and imprisonment.”</p></blockquote>
        <p>Additionally, according to California Vehicle Code 13210, any operator of a motor vehicle who commits a “road rage” assault can have their driving privilege suspended for 6 months to one year, following either the incident or release from imprisonment, and/or may be required to complete a court-ordered anger management course.</p>
        <p>Often the incidents that spark road rage seem rather benign in hindsight and can often boil down to a simple misunderstanding or an assumption that another driver had evil intentions rather than a momentary lapse in judgment. Of course, one does not typically attempt to injure others with a 2-ton machine because of a simple misunderstanding! That is usually just the last straw on a pile of frustrations and bad experiences for that particular driver, whether personal or professional, that triggers an extreme and violent reaction directed at the other driver.</p>
        <p>It certainly doesn’t help that roadway congestion has steadily increased at a rate greater than road capacity. More of us are driving more often and at greater distances than ever before. It’s no wonder frustrations build on the road! And with most states and counties cutting budgets where they can, there are fewer instances of aggressive drivers being warned or ticketed by the local law enforcement. So be mindful of these changes and make an extra effort to keep yourself calm and courteous. Give up your right of way when it promotes safety and give each other the benefit of the doubt.</p>

        <h3><span>A.</span> HOW TO HANDLE ANOTHER DRIVER EXHIBITING ROAD RAGE/BEING AGGRESSIVE</h3>

        <p>Although road rage (as defined above) is a rare occurrence, aggressive drivers are not. Knowing what to do if and when you cross paths with such a driver can help to keep you and your loved ones safe. Of course, the best medicine is always prevention, so keep the following tips in mind as you prepare to join others on the road.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Add on at least 25% more time than you expect your journey to take. So if you expect your trip to take an hour, give yourself an hour and 15 minutes. Most aggressive driving and road rage incidents begin with someone feeling rushed and impatient. If you get to your destination early, just enjoy the down time! Grab a cup of coffee, get out and stretch your legs or keep a good book in your car. It’s better to have a few extra minutes to yourself than to risk being inciting an incident on the road.</li>
          <li>This should be a given, but don’t cut any other drivers off. Not only is it rude, it’s also unsafe. Causing another driver to slam on their brakes to accommodate your poor execution could not only cause an accident, but also anger the other driver unnecessarily. Again, you do not know the mental stability (or lack thereof!) of the other people around you, so don’t take that risk.</li>
          <li>This is a big one: do NOT drive slower than the flow of traffic in the far left lane. That lane is intended for passing and for drivers who do not need to exit the freeway or highway for a number of miles. Slow driving in those lanes causes unnecessary bottlenecks in the traffic pattern, leading to more frustrations, anger, unsafe passing, tailgating, etc. Save everyone the hassle and keep right except to pass.</li>
          <li>If you are behind a vehicle traveling slower than the flow of traffic, don’t tailgate him or her. Instead, be patient and pass that vehicle when it is safe to do so.</li>
          <li>Avoid making gestures at other drivers. Even if your gesture is well meaning, the other driver may misinterpret it and become angry. Of course, if your gesture is not well meaning, don’t do it. You just don’t know who you’re flipping off and it’s not worth the risk.</li>
          <li>Use your horn appropriately – only to prevent accidents!</li>
          <li>Pay attention! If you are distracted by a conversation, a text, your delicious hamburger or getting that lipstick just right, you are likely to drive your car poorly and instigate a dangerous situation on the road.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you are a perfect angel on the road, but still come in contact with an aggressive driver, here are some ways to return to your Zen state safely.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Toss your pride out the window. You don’t need it for this situation. Remember their behavior is not personal to you – it is a reflection of their own state of mind. Don’t “fight back” with aggressive behaviors of your own, such as speeding, tailgating, cutting him or her off and then slamming on your brakes, etc. These are unsafe and confrontational acts that will escalate, not diffuse, the situation.</li>
          <li>Avoid directly staring or making eye contact with an angry driver. Just like staring at a dog will lead to a growl or a bite, making eye contact with an angry driver will just escalate the issue to a potentially dangerous level.</li>
          <li>Make sure to increase your space cushion around the aggressive driver. Move into a more distant lane or slow down to get away from him or her. Do what you can to get out of their way and let them pass.</li>
          <li>If the aggressive driver seems to be following you, do not go home or pull over to start throwing fists. Drive to the nearest police station or busy shopping center to get help. If you have a hands-free device or passenger in your car, alert the police and continue driving safely forward until you are given instructions.</li>
          <li>If you are on city streets and believe you are being followed by an aggressive driver, make sure your windows and sunroof are closed and doors are locked. If you are approaching stopped traffic or a red light, leave at least one car length between you and the car in front of you so you have room to maneuver if you need to pull away from the aggressive driver.</li>
          <li>If an aggressive driver gets out of their car, do what you can to attract the attention of the other drivers by honking your horn or shouting for help. Call the police if you are able to do so. Do not get out of your car.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><span>B.</span> KEEPING YOUR OWN EMOTIONS IN CHECK</h3>

        <p>We cannot control the emotions and behavior of others, but we can control our own. If we each take responsibility for our own actions and behavior, we can make driving a whole lot safer! To find out if you’re an aggressive driver, answer the following questions asked by the NHTSA:<sup>49</sup></p>

        </div>
        <p>DO YOU:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Express Frustration? Taking out your frustrations on your fellow motorists can lead to violence or a crash.</li>
          <li>Fail to Pay Attention when Driving? Reading, eating, drinking or talking on the phone, can be a major cause of roadway crashes.</li>
          <li>Tailgate? This is a major cause of crashes that can result in serious deaths or injuries.</li>
          <li>Make Frequent Lane Changes? If you whip in and out of lanes to advance ahead, you can be a danger to other motorists.
          <img src="../images/curriculum-images/58-viii_b_.jpg" cclass="img-responsive center-block" alt="image of stop signal" style="max-width:300px;">
          </li>
          <li>Run Red Lights? Do not enter an intersection on a yellow light. Remember flashing red lights should be treated as a stop sign.</li>
          <li>Speed? Going faster than the posted speed limit, being a “road racer” and going too fast for conditions are some examples of speeding.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If your answer is yes to these questions, you are an aggressive driver! The good news is you don’t have to continue being one. Consider the following suggestions to change your ways and keep others around you safe.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Give yourself that extra cushion of time, adding at least 25% more time than you expect your trip to take.</li>
          <li>Relax! Bring your favorite stand-up comedy routine or put together a playlist that will help you relax and enjoy the trip. Pull over and take breaks at coffee shops or hobby stores if the traffic is getting to you. You could also try to concentrate on something positive, relax your jaw, loosen your grip on the steering wheel, and do some deep breathing exercises.</li>
          <li>Map out alternative routes before you head out in case you hit heavy congestion. Avoid delays by using <a href="http://www.sigalert.com" target="new">Sig Alert</a> or other traffic patterns websites that can tell you which roads are blocked in real time.</li>
          <li>Do not speed. Speeding is a large component in accidents on the road, so don’t do it. The limits are there for a reason! It’s not safe to whiz by other vehicles on the road.</li>
          <li>Use public transportation where possible. If you know you’re too upset by personal matters or you just don’t have the patience for other drivers that day, hop on a bus or train and just enjoy being chauffeured for a day.</li>
          <li>If all of your best efforts fail you, then just be late. It’s better than being dead or injured or than causing someone else’s death or injury. It absolutely CAN happen to you, so don’t be foolish thinking you’re immune to mistakes and accidents.</li>
        </ul>
