        <h3><span>A.</span> RULES OF THE ROAD</h3>

        <h4><span>1.</span> use of lanes</h4>

        <img src="../images/curriculum-clipart/clip-art-26.jpg" alt="clipart of traffic">
        <p>Traffic lanes are often identified as the “Fast” (left lane), “slow” (far right lane), and “middle” (self-explanatory) lanes. By selecting the appropriate lane for your journey, you can help prevent collisions. Look for the lane with the smoothest flow of traffic and the least amount of congestion. These lanes are usually safer and reduce your risk of collision.</p>
        <p>The slow lane is often the most congested because vehicles use this lane to enter and exit the road from intersections, on or off-ramps, driveways, etc. Also drivers in the left lane are often looking for parking along the streets, loading or unloading passengers, trying to read addresses, etc.</p>
        <p>If all lanes are relatively equivalent, choose the middle lane for the smoothest experience. If you need to pass a vehicle in front of you or you would like to drive faster or make a left turn, choose the left lane. If you need to enter or exit the road or would like to drive more slowly, then choose the right lane for your travel. If there are only two lanes, use the right lane in general and use the left for passing or turning left.</p>
        <p>Weaving in and out of traffic is dangerous and increases your risk of collision. When you make your lane selection, commit to it until you need to pass a vehicle or exit the road. If you cannot move over to the left or right lanes in time to make a turn or exit the road, it’s safest to simply continue on the road, and then adjust your route or turn around when safe to do so ahead. If you are in the process of changing lanes or making a turn and realize you’ve made a mistake in your route, complete the lane change or turn and adjust when safe to turn around. If you make a sudden change like either of these situations, you are likely to surprise the other drivers around you and cause a collision.</p>

        <h5><span>a.</span> Bicycle lanes</h5>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <img src="../images/curriculum-images/25-xi_a_1.a.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="image of bike lane">
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>You may have seen road markings that use a drawing of a bicycle accompanied by two chevrons. These markings are called <strong>sharrows</strong> and are used to indicate to motorists that bicyclists are lawfully allowed to share the lane. They also help bicyclists identify the best positioning on a shared road, but do not restrict the bicyclist to that portion of the lane.</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <img src="../images/curriculum-images/26-xi_a_1.a.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="image of bike lane">
          </div>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Bicycle lanes</strong> are marked by a solid white lane on either side of a drawing of a bicycle, typically with a dotted line ending just before corners and intersections. Bicycle lanes follow very specific width requirements and indicate the portion of the lane which the bicyclist may occupy.</p>
        <p>A bicyclist may ride in the center of the lane if there are conditions present that make it unsafe to ride in such a way to allow room for vehicles to pass. As with any other slow moving vehicle or bicycle, motorists must follow at a safe distance. Once it is safe, the bicyclist should then move to a position on the road to allow vehicles to pass. Motorists should remember that bicyclists do have the right to share the road with other vehicles. Similarly, bicyclists must follow traffic laws and have the same rights and responsibilities as other vehicles and motorcyclists.</p>
        <p>As a motorist, it is important to treat a bicycle lane as you would any other traffic lane. Do not drift into that lane or drive in it. If you must turn right across the lane, be sure to check your mirrors and glance to your blind spots to be certain you are safely clear of any bicyclists. Treat a turn through a bicycle lane as you would any lane change. Only cross or drive in the bicycle lane when you are within 200 feet of your turn and only after ensuring there is no bicycle traffic.</p>
        <p>Motorists are legally required to maintain a width of no less than 3 feet from a bicyclist when overtaking or passing a bicycle heading in the same direction. This means that any part of the vehicle must be at least 3 feet away from any part of the bicycle or its operator. If traffic or roadway conditions do not allow for at least 3 feet of space between vehicle and bicycle, the driver shall slow to a reasonable and prudent speed, passing only when doing so would not endanger the safety of the bicycle operator. Whenever passing a bicyclist, the driver must take the following into account: the size and speed of the motor vehicle and bicycle, traffic conditions, weather, visibility, and surface and width of the highway.</p>

        <h5><span>b.</span> Ending turns</h5>

        <p>On city streets, often you will find a designated lane for turning left or right. These lanes will be marked with a solid white line between the turn lane and the through lanes going straight, as well as an arrow pointing in the direction of the turn. On some occasions, there will be both a straight arrow and a turn arrow, indicating you may either proceed in that lane or turn in the direction of the arrow. If there is only an arrow pointing left or right, you must make that turn if you are in that lane because the lane will not continue beyond the intersection. You should also see signs to the side of the road saying “Right Turn Only” or “Left Turn Only” as you approach the intersection.</p>
        <p>Freeway lanes, as well as some city street lanes, which are ending will usually be marked by large broken lines painted on the pavement. If you happen to be in a lane marked with these broken lines, be prepared to exit the freeway or for the lane to end. Look for signs that tell you to exit or merge, etc., and confirm you are in the appropriate lane well before the lane ends or the exit approaches.</p>
        <p>When approaching and executing a right-hand turn, drive as close as is safe and practical to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway. There are a few exceptions to this rule related to multi-lane and one-way roadways. These exceptions will be covered in Section 3.l. below. </p>
        <p>When approaching and executing a left-hand turn, drive as close as is safe and practical to the left-hand edge of the extreme left-hand lane or portion of the roadway on your side of the road. When turning at an intersection, don’t begin or execute the left-hand turn before actually entering the intersection. We will go into more details regarding in which lanes you must end your left-hand turns in Section 3.l. below.</p>


        <h5><span>c.</span> Center left turn lanes</h5>

        <p>A center left turn lane is located in the middle of a two-way street and is marked on both sides by two yellow painted lines. The inner line is broken and the outer line is solid. If a street has a center left turn lane, you must use it to prepare for or make a left turn, or to prepare for or make a permitted U-turn (CVC §21460.5 (c)). Keep in mind you may only drive for 200 feet in the center left turn lane. This lane is not a regular traffic lane or a passing lane, so do not enter it until you are ready to make your turn. To turn left from this lane, treat this as any normal lane change: activate your turn signal, look over your shoulder to check your blind spots, and drive completely inside the center left turn lane. Do not stop with the back of your vehicle blocking traffic.</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <img src="../images/curriculum-images/27-xi_a_c.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="image of center lane">
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Make sure the lane is clear in both directions and then turn only when it is safe. Both directions of traffic may use this lane, so be sure to look for any approaching traffic signaling their intention to use the lane ahead of you. This is another good reason not to enter the lane too far ahead of your turn: you may end up blocked by an oncoming vehicle until they are able to execute their turn, allowing you to proceed.</p>
        <p>When turning left from a side street or driveway, signal and wait until it is safe. Then you may drive into the center left turn lane and activate your right turn signal to alert traffic of your intention to merge. Enter traffic only when it is safe. This is especially convenient when turning left onto a busy street because you will only need to cross one direction of traffic at a time.</p>
        <p>You may also drive across a center left turn lane when turning left onto a main street from a side street or driveway, if it is safe to do so.</p>


        <h5><span>d.</span> Motorcycle speed used when passing other vehicles and splitting lane rules</h5>

        <p>Motorcyclists are permitted to pass other vehicles during congested conditions and therefore travel faster than other traffic. They are legally permitted to drive in the space between two lanes of moving or stationary vehicles, a maneuver known as “<strong>lane splitting</strong>.” Splitting a lane can be very dangerous, so drivers of motorcycles and the surrounding vehicles should use extra care. Consider that the motorcycle will be closer than usual to two lanes of traffic, so the driver must be looking for any indication that vehicles on either side intend to change lanes or swerve toward the motorcycle. Additionally, the motorcycle is likely to be riding in one or more blind spots for the surrounding vehicles at any given moment. All drivers, whether on motorcycles or in other vehicles, should therefore use care when executing lane changes in congested traffic, especially considering motorcycles will likely be traveling much faster than the slow-moving vehicles.</p>
        <p>Here are some best practices to consider when sharing the road with motorcyclists:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Allow motorcycles a full lane width whenever possible. Lane splitting is legal, but it is inherently more dangerous for both parties.</li>
          <li>Do NOT try to pass a motorcycle in the same lane that you are sharing.</li>
          <li>Leave at least a four-second following distance behind a motorcycle. If you are tail-gating or following too closely when the motorcycle stops suddenly or the motorcyclist falls off of the vehicle, you could potentially kill him or her by hitting or running over the person. There are no reasons that could justify exposing others to this kind of risk.</li>
          <li>When changing lanes or merging with traffic, make a visual check for motorcycles. Use your eyes by turning your head to your blind spots and use your mirrors to check all other areas. Motorcycles are small and often traveling faster than other traffic, so they can be easy to miss.</li>
          <li>When making a turn, be sure to scan for motorcycles and gauge their speed. Turn only if you may do so safely before they reach your position. Otherwise wait until they pass to execute.</li>
          <li>Similarly, check for motorcycles before opening car doors next to moving traffic.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5><span>e.</span> Carpool Lanes</h5>

        <p>Carpool lanes are reserved exclusively for cars with two or more occupants. These lanes are also known as High Occupancy Vehicle Lanes or HOV lanes. This means that least two people, or in some cases three people, must be in the vehicle.  Children count as occupants, but pets, a fetus in the womb, inflatable dolls and ghosts do not count as occupants (believe it or not).  The following applies to carpool lanes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>They are marked with signs and a diamond symbol in roadway.  </li>
            <li>They are marked at on-ramps with the number of occupants required and times of day at which carpooling is required.  </li>
            <li>Carpool lanes are sometimes constructed with double yellow lines to the right of the vehicle and with specific exit and entry points marked by a broken white line. This means that you cannot cross over double lines to enter or exit, but must wait until you have a broken line indicating it is permitted to move in and out of that lane.  </li>
            <li>They may include lanes reserved for buses on freeways that are also marked with a diamond symbol.</li>
            <li>A single occupant vehicle may drive in a carpool lane if the vehicle has a WHITE or GREEN Clean Air Vehicle Decal.  The Yellow Decals are no longer valid.</li>
            <li>Drivers who use a carpool lane without two or more people in their vehicle or a white or green CAV decal will be issued a citation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Keep in mind that conditions you would consider to be minor annoyances may pose major hazards to motorcyclists. Road conditions such as potholes, gravel, railroad crossings, grooved or uneven pavement, or slippery surfaces may cause a motorcyclist to swerve, alter speed or change lanes suddenly. By being aware of and alert to these conditions and by driving with extra care, you can help reduce motorcyclist injuries and fatalities!</p>

        <h4><span>2.</span> Passing other vehicles</h4>

        <p>If you are driving behind a vehicle you would like to pass, you may do so provided the street markings allow it and provided you do not endanger any other motorist in front of or behind you. When determining whether or not you may pass, look at the lines painted on the street pavement. If there is a broken line on the side of the lane you are in, you are permitted to cross that line to pass. If there is a solid line on the side of the lane you occupy, you may not cross it.</p>
        <p><strong>When Being Passed</strong></p>
        <p>On any given day, there will be vehicles that are traveling or want to travel faster than you do and will attempt to pass you. Not only is it the action of a good neighbor to yield when being passed, but it is also required by law that overtaken vehicles must yield. You may not accelerate to prevent another vehicle from passing you or move to block the overtaking vehicle. Instead, maintain your current speed or slow down slightly in order to make the pass safer for all involved. If the driver of the overtaking vehicle misjudges the space in front of your vehicle and moves in front of you too soon, simply release the accelerator in order to slow down or gently brake to allow for more space between you. </p>
        <p>The California Vehicle Code says the following in Section 21753 Yielding for Passing:</p>
        <blockquote><p>Except when passing on the right is permitted, the driver of an overtaken vehicle shall safely move to the right-hand side of the highway in favor of the overtaking vehicle after an audible signal or a momentary flash of headlights by the overtaking vehicle, and shall not increase the speed of his or her vehicle until completely passed by the overtaking vehicle. This section does not require the driver of an overtaken vehicle to drive on the shoulder of the highway in order to allow the overtaking vehicle to pass.</p></blockquote>
        <p>So take steps to keep roadways safer by being courteous while being overtaken. If this is a trigger for you to become an aggressive driver or slip into road rage, be sure to review Section VIII.B – Keeping Your Own Emotions in Check.</p>
        <p><strong>When Passing</strong></p>
        <p>When you are the vehicle that wants to do the passing, be careful and courteous to the other motorists around you. Always alert other drivers of your intention to turn by activating your turn signal in advance of your maneuver. Do not initiate a pass unless you are certain you have enough space to pull back into the lane ahead of the vehicle in front of you. Do not pass multiple vehicles at one time. It is too dangerous to assume you have that much time and space and to assume the other drivers will make room for you to reenter the lane.</p>
        <p>When traveling on highways at speeds of 50-55 mph, you will need a gap of approximately 10-12 seconds in oncoming traffic in order to safely pass the car in front of you. Keep in mind you will travel over 800 feet in that time frame when traveling 55 mph, and so will the oncoming traffic. That means you will need at least 1,600 feet, or one third of a mile, to pass safely. It is quite difficult to gauge the distance and speed of oncoming traffic that is one third of a mile away from you! So, if you are uncertain whether or not you have enough time and space to pass, refrain from passing. It is better to drive more slowly than you’d like than to risk a collision. </p>
        <p>Wherever possible, avoid passing other vehicles when traveling on two-lane roads. This includes motorcycles and bicycles. Passing increases your chances of collisions, so you can decrease this risk by decreasing the number of times you pass other vehicles. </p>
        <p>If you must pass a bicyclist, exercise care and patience. Slow down and maintain a safe following distance until the way is clear and it is safe to pass him or her with 3 feet between you. Do not maneuver such that the bicyclist is forced off of the road. </p>
        <p>Keep in mind that oncoming vehicles far enough away will actually appear to be standing still. Always assume the other vehicles are traveling more quickly than they seem because we often misjudge the speed of other objects. A good rule of thumb is if you can see that the vehicle is moving toward you, it is too close to safely initiate a pass.</p>

        <h5><span>a.</span> Special situations</h5>
        <p>The following special situations will require you to judge whether or not you have enough room to pass within the parameters outlined below. Again, if you are uncertain whether or not it is safe to pass, assume it is not safe to pass. It is better to wait a little longer than to kill or be killed in a collision.</p>
        <p><strong>i. Bridges Or Abutments:</strong>&nbsp When you are approaching or on a bridge or abutment, you may pass if there is a broken line adjacent to your lane indicating you are permitted to pass, and if you have adequate visibility, space, and time. You may not pass when your view is obstructed within 100 feet of any bridge or abutment, viaduct or tunnel.</p>
        <p><strong>ii. On Hills:</strong>&nbsp When approaching a hill or curve, you are not permitted to pass if you are unable to see whether or not an oncoming vehicle is approaching you. Also, according to the California Vehicle Code Section 21752, you may not drive to the left side of the road (i.e., pass a vehicle) when “approaching or upon the crest of a grade or a curve in the highway where the driver's view is obstructed within such distance as to create a hazard in the event another vehicle might approach from the opposite direction.”</p>
        <p><strong>iii. Intersections Or Railroad Crossings:</strong>&nbsp You may not pass another vehicle if you are within 100 feet or are crossing any intersection or railroad grade crossing. It is simply unsafe, dangerous and not worth the risk.</p>
        <p><strong>iv. Class A and Class B vehicles:</strong>&nbsp When passing Class A and Class B vehicles, which are trucks, trailers, buses, etc., weighing 6-10,000+ pounds, keep in mind that these vehicles are slow and heavy. They require much longer stopping distances and need to maintain much greater following distances. Also their blind spots are larger and they need more room to execute turns, often taking up 2-3 lanes to do so on city streets. Never try to pass a truck on the right side on city streets because if they are turning right from the middle lane, your car will be crushed.</p>
        <p><img src="../images/curriculum-clipart/clip-art-27.jpg" alt="clipart of transport truck"></p>
        <p>On highways and freeways where you are traveling at high speeds, allow these vehicles the extra following distance and never cut them off. If you leave them with too little room and then have to stop suddenly, they will not be able to stop without rear-ending you. If you would like to pass a Class A or B vehicle, allow more time and space to do so. When you are ready to reenter the lane, position your vehicle well ahead of the Class A or B vehicle, signal your intention to move in front of them and give them a chance to register that intention. Often the truck driver will flash his or her lights at you, which is an indicator you are safe to proceed. (It is not necessary to wait for this acknowledgement, but it is a courtesy.) Before reentering the lane, SCAN ahead to be sure traffic is not coming to a stop and that no hazards are visible that would require you to slam on your brakes once in the lane.</p>

        <h5><span>b.</span> Dangerous situations</h5>
        <p>When you would like to pass a vehicle in front of you, be especially alert during the dangerous situations outlined below.</p>
        <p><strong>i. Long Line Of Vehicles Ahead:</strong>&nbsp A long line of vehicles in front of you will likely indicate that there is some sort of delay or hazard up ahead, or at the very least warn of a period of traffic congestion. In such cases, it is futile and dangerous to pass. The drivers are not necessarily traveling slower than you wish to go because that is their preference – it may be because that is the fastest speed of travel that is possible or safe! Also, there is no guarantee that there will be enough space (or that the other drivers will make room) for you to re-enter your driving lane once you do overtake the other vehicle.</p>
        <p><strong>ii. Intention To Stop Or Turn:</strong>&nbsp When preparing to pass a driver who appears to be paying more attention to available parking spaces, street signs or building addresses, use extra care. It is possible that the driver is not paying attention to the flow of traffic or neighboring vehicles. If the driver sees that his or her turn or destination is actually farther ahead than they’d thought or that there is no parking along the side of the street, he or she may resume driving with the flow of traffic without confirming that it is safe to do so. If you were in the middle of executing a pass, this could leave you stuck in the lane for oncoming traffic or rear-ended by the inattentive driver.</p>
        <p>It would be best to wait for the driver to turn or pull over at his or her destination, rather than pass. If you must pass, be sure you allocate an additional length of time and space before attempting to execute a pass around such a driver and be prepared to use your horn should the driver resume travel in the lane without first checking the conditions.</p>
        <p><strong>iii. Vehicle Ahead Is At Or Near Speed Limit:</strong>&nbsp If you are behind a vehicle that is at or near the speed limit, refrain from passing. Instead, allocate a safety cushion of 3 or more seconds behind the vehicle and maintain the speed limit. Attempting to pass such a vehicle would require either a much longer distance to overtake it or speeds above the posted speed limit. Remember that passing is legal, but speeding is not. If you must speed in order to pass, you must not pass.</p>
        <p><strong>iv. Sight/distance ahead is limited</strong> Remember that safe passing requires at least one third of a mile of visibility at speeds of 55 mph. If you cannot see far enough ahead, it is dangerous to pass. This puts you and the oncoming traffic at very serious risk of a head-on collision. It’s never worth the risk, so slow down and wait until you have better conditions to pass safely.</p>
        <img src="../images/curriculum-images/31-xi_a_2.b.iv.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="image of obscured passing lane">
        <p><strong>v. unable to pass before reaching no passing zone</strong> If you are approaching a no passing zone, you should see road signs indicating the change is coming and you should see the broken line next to your lane change to a solid line up ahead. If you see that you do not have the space to pass and reenter your driving lane before you reach the no passing zone, it is not safe to initiate the maneuver. Sections of the road are designated as no passing zones because the conditions of the road are not safe for you to pass. It may be due to a curve or hill obstructing your visibility, or any number of other reasons. It’s best to trust the designation and refrain from passing until you reach safer conditions.</p>

        <h4><span>3.</span> Right-of-way situations</h4>

        <p>The rules of right-of-way make traveling on roadways much safer. Imagine a driving world without them - cars darting across intersections, bullies pushing people off the road, timid drivers never getting beyond their first left turn. It would be chaos! Right-of-way rules also promote the safety (and lives!) of pedestrians, motorcyclists and bicyclists. These rules are in place for the benefit and safety of all of us on the road, so respect them and be courteous to others on the road with you.</p>
        <p>Never ever assume other drivers will give you the right-of-way and give yours up any time it can help prevent a collision. If you have the choice between being “right” and avoiding an accident, always choose to avoid the accident! Drivers must also respect the right-of-way rules by refraining from violating traffic laws, such as speeding, making illegal turns, running stop signs or red lights, etc.</p>
        <p>In order to follow the right-of-way rules, one of course must know them. Let’s take a look at the following situations and identify who has the right of way.</p>

        <h5><span>a.</span> Controlled intersections (at 4-way stop, yield sign, unprotected left turn)</h5>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <img src="../images/curriculum-images/44-xi_a_3.a.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="image of stop sign">
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Did you know that, according to the Federal Highway Administration, more than 45% of all reported crashes and 21% of all traffic fatalities occur at intersections? That’s astounding! A large contributing factor to that statistic is the failure of drivers to follow right-of-way rules. Therefore, it is highly recommended that you pay special attention when traversing an intersection. Slow down and SCAN!</p>
        <p>Since this is such an important topic, let’s back up and define what an intersection is. An intersection is any place where one roadway meets, or “intersects”, another roadway. This could be cross streets, side streets, alleys, freeway entrances, etc... Traversing an intersection is one of the most complicated traffic maneuvers you will perform as a driver. Here are some important safety tips related to intersections and your right-of-way:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When approaching a 4-way stop, i.e., an intersection with “STOP” signs posted at all 4 directions of traffic, yield to the traffic already in the intersection or to who got there first. Be sure to pay attention to who arrived first and yield to that person. If you and another vehicle or bicycle arrive at the same time, yield to the person on the right. If you are the person on the right, make eye contact with the other driver to confirm they will yield to you before you exercise your right-of-way. If the other driver wasn’t paying attention and proceeds through the intersection, give up your right-of-way. Yield to any pedestrian traffic unless they have signaled to you that they are yielding to you.</li>
          <li>When executing an unprotected left turn, i.e., there is no traffic signal designated for left turns or there is no traffic signal at all, the on-coming traffic has the right-of-way. Wait for a break in traffic that is large enough for you to safely execute your turn. Again, when in doubt, wait. Remember to check for bicycles, pedestrians and motorcycles that may be traversing the street you are turning on before you execute your turn. (When waiting to turn left, it’s a safe practice to keep your wheels pointed forward until you are actually ready to turn. That way, if you are rear-ended, you will be pushed straight ahead. If your wheels are turned toward the left and you are rear-ended, you will be pushed into oncoming traffic.)</li>
          <li>When merging with traffic at a “YIELD” sign, the cars already on the road have the right-of-way and you must wait for an opening large enough to accommodate your vehicle and the amount of time it will take you to catch up to the speed of traffic.</li>
          <li>When approaching intersections that do not have a “STOP” or “YIELD” sign, slow your speed and cover your brakes. Yield to any traffic, including any vehicles, pedestrians and bicyclists, already in or just entering the intersection. Yield to any traffic that reaches the intersection before you. If you and another vehicle or bicycle arrive at the same time, follow the same rules as you would for the same scenario at a 4-way stop. Yield to any pedestrian traffic unless they have signaled to you that they are yielding to you.</li>
          <li>When approaching a “T” intersection, where one roadway ends at the intersection with another, that doesn’t have any “STOP” or “YIELD” signs, yield to the traffic and pedestrians traveling on the through road. They do have the right-of-way.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5><span>b.</span> Intersections when signal is out</h5>
        <p>Every so often you will come across an intersection with a traffic signal blackout. In these situations, you must come to a full and complete stop at the signal or intersection. Look for a traffic officer to see if anyone is directing traffic. If so, watch the traffic officer and wait for instructions. If no one is present, have heightened awareness of the other vehicles on the road and yield when necessary. Often the group will treat the intersection as a modified 4-way stop, with a group of cars crossing the intersection from one direction at a time, rather than one car from each direction at a time. Keep in mind pedestrians and bicyclists will also be attempting to cross without a signal, so always yield to that traffic as well.</p>

        <p>When approaching a crosswalk, you should have heightened awareness. SCAN for pedestrians near or approaching the crosswalk and do a visual sweep from one side of the road to the other. If there is a vehicle stopped at a crosswalk, do not proceed through the crosswalk or pass the vehicle. Assume the vehicle has stopped for a pedestrian. Come to a full stop. Proceed only when all pedestrians have completely cleared the crosswalk and are off the roadway.</p>

        <h5><span>d.</span> Respecting the pedestrian right of way at crosswalks (with/without lines, right turns) and driveways</h5>
        <p>In California alone, pedestrian fatalities occur in approximately 19 percent of all traffic fatalities. This is a serious safety issue that can be reduced by motorists using extra caution in and awareness of the surrounding driving environment. </p>
        <p>The part of the roadway designated for pedestrian traffic is known as a “crosswalk.” Crosswalks do not always have lines painted to identify them. Most intersections have pedestrian crosswalks, regardless of whether there are painted lines or not. If there are no signs pointing pedestrians to another side of the street or specifically forbidding pedestrian traffic, assume there is a pedestrian crosswalk at that roadway. Most crosswalks are located at corners, but they may also be in the middle of the clock. Always be certain to SCAN for pedestrians before turning or traversing an intersection. Pedestrians always have the right of way in marked and unmarked crosswalks.</p>

        <h5><span>e.</span> Respecting the bicyclist’s right of way, share the road, entitled to use turn lanes, stay to right when</h5>
        <img src="../images/curriculum-clipart/clip-art-28.gif" alt="clipart of bicyclist">
        <p>You must respect the right-of-way of bicyclists because they are entitled to share the road with motorists. Below are the Do’s and Don’ts of sharing the road with bicycle traffic.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Before opening car doors when parked alongside moving traffic, double check the bike lanes to be certain you’re clear of bicyclists. If there is an approaching cyclist in the lane, ensure they have enough room to pass without colliding into your vehicle door or without being edged into the traffic lane. In some cases, it may be safest to wait for the cyclist to pass before opening your vehicle door and exiting the car.</li>
          <li>If a bicyclist in riding in the bike lane near a right turn that you need to make, slow down and wait for the cyclist to clear the turn before you proceed. Over 70% of crashes involving cars with bicyclists happen in intersections and driveways, so stay alert!</li>
          <li>Always make sure to do a visual check for bicyclists before entering traffic and/or changing lanes. Keep in mind bicycles are relatively small and may not be immediately visible or may be in the vehicle’s blind spot.</li>
          <li>Do not try to pass a bicyclist just before making a turn and do not enter the bike lane for a turn until you are within 200 feet of your turn.</li>
          <li>Use extra care when approaching and/or passing a bicyclist on a two-lane highway or freeway. Be sure to leave 3 feet of a space cushion when passing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5><span>f.</span> Anti-gridlock law</h5>
        <p>Gridlock is one of California’s biggest traffic problems, according to a recent study by the California Office of Traffic Safety. Consequently, California enacted the Anti-Gridlock law, as outlined in California Vehicle Code 22526. The basic gist is that it is now illegal to enter an intersection, crosswalk, or railroad or rail transit crossing, “unless there is sufficient space on the other side of the intersection or crosswalk [or railroad or rail transit] to accommodate the vehicle driven without obstructing the through passage of vehicles from either side.” So now what used to just be considered rude is actually illegal. You can get cited and fined for a stopping violation or a parking violation if you do decide to enter one of the aforementioned roadways without sufficient room to clear it. Fines and penalties vary from city to city.</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <img src="../images/curriculum-images/49-xi_a_3.f.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="image of anti-gridlock sign">
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>So pay attention to the line of cars ahead. If the cars are slowly proceeding through the intersection or your light has turned yellow, stop and wait before you enter the intersection until there is enough space for you to proceed.</p>

        <h5><span>g.</span> School buses with red flashing lights</h5>
        <p>When a school bus stops and flashes red lights, that is effectively equivalent to a stop sign. Traffic from both directions must stop until the children have safely crossed the street and the red lights have been turned off. As long as the red lights are flashing, you are not permitted to proceed. If you fail to stop or proceed before the red lights have been turned off, you could be fined up to $1,000 and your driving privileges could be suspended for one year!! The inconvenience of being unable to drive for one year far outweighs the minute or two delay of stopping for the school bus – not to mention the fact that you actually risk the lives of children by disobeying this law.</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <img src="../images/curriculum-images/17-xi_a_3.g.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="image of stopped school bus">
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The caveat to this, as outlined in the California Vehicle Code 22454 is that, if the school bus is on the other side of a divided highway or multi-lane highway (i.e., there are two or more lanes in each direction), you do not need to stop. </p>

        <h5><span>h.</span> Where road or lane narrows</h5>
        <p>When traveling on a roadway with two lanes that merge into one, you will see signs indicating which lane is ending, whether the left or the right. The lane that ends will also have large white arrows pointing diagonally toward the lane you must merge into. The vehicles in the through lane have the right of way. If you are in the lane that ends, turn on your turn signal and begin looking for an opening in the lane you must merge into. If you are in the through lane, be sure to make space for the other lane to merge with yours. Speeding up to block someone from merging is not only rude but also dangerous. If you block them and their lane comes to an end, you could be at fault for causing a collision with them. Putting others at risk in this way is not worth the couple of extra seconds of time you may gain and it is unkind.</p>

        <h5><span>i.</span> Entering freeways</h5>
        <p>When entering a freeway, the traffic already on the freeway has the right of way. In most cases, you will find an on-ramp or acceleration lane that allows drivers entering from city streets the time to accelerate to the speed of the highway traffic in order to merge seamlessly with the flow of traffic. If there is no such acceleration lane or lengthy on-ramp, then you must wait for a long enough break in traffic to allow for you to accelerate to the highway speed without causing other drivers to brake suddenly or swerve to avoid hitting you. If you enter a double merge lane, where two lanes of city traffic enter one acceleration lane, you will typically find signs or traffic lights to help dictate right of way and stagger the traffic allowed in the acceleration lane.</p>
        <p>Be sure to obey all yield and merge signs, if any, and signal when you are ready to merge from the acceleration lane. Don’t forget to check your blind spots and check the traffic ahead to make sure no vehicles are stopping or slowing suddenly.</p>

        <h5><span>j.</span> Where u-turns are illegal</h5>
        <img src="../images/curriculum-clipart/clip-art-29.jpg" alt="clipart of no u-turn sign">
        <p>A U-turn, whereby you turn your vehicle around in the street to go back the way you came, is legal at all times in an intersection unless a “No U-turn” sign is posted. A U-turn is also legal in residential areas when no vehicles are approaching within 200 feet or on a divided highway where an opening or break in the divider section has been provided for one.</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <img src="../images/curriculum-images/29-xi_a_3.j.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="image of no u-turn area">
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>A U-turn is illegal in the following scenarios:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>At or on a railroad crossing</li>
          <li>On a divided highway that does not have an opening or break in the divider section</li>
          <li>Where you do not have 200 feet of visibility in each direction due to inclement weather, a curve or hill obstructing your view, or for any other reason.</li>
          <li>Where a “No U-Turn” sign is posted</li>
          <li>When doing so would risk a collision with another vehicle, bicyclist or pedestrian</li>
          <li>On a one-way street</li>
          <li>In front of a fire station – never use these driveways in order to turn your vehicle around</li>
          <li>In business districts, which are areas where more than 50% of the buildings are not single family homes</li>
        </ul>

        <h5><span>k.</span> Railroad crossings</h5>
        <p>In 2013, according to the Federal Railroad Administration, California had an estimated 118 collisions with motor vehicle traffic occurring at railroad crossings, with a loss of 43 lives.<sup>52</sup> This loss of life is unnecessary and can be prevented by drivers being cautious when traversing railroad crossings.</p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <img src="../images/curriculum-images/5-xi_a_3.k.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="image of railroad sign">
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Always pay extra attention when nearing a railroad crossing. Listen for the sounds of an approaching train and look for warning signs in the surrounding area. When you see a train approaching, stop and wait for it to pass before attempting to traverse the rails. Trains travel quickly and require a long runway to come to a full stop. For example, if a train is traveling at 55mph, it will need about a mile to come to a full stop.</p>
        <p>If a signal device, whether human, electric or mechanical, warns of an approaching train or if a train is visible or audible, you must stop at least 15 feet from the railroad crossing. If the gates are lowered and you don’t see a train, it is still illegal to attempt to drive around or through the gates. You must wait until the train passes and the gates or warning devices signal that it is safe to proceed.</p>
        <p>If your vehicle stalls on the tracks, immediately evacuate the car and contact the police. If a train approaches while your car is on the tracks, run in the direction the train is coming so that you do not get hit by any debris from the inevitable collision.</p>

        <h5><span>l.</span> Proper lanes to end turns</h5>
        <p>As promised in Section 1.b. above, we will now discuss the exceptions for executing right-hand turns. Again, in most cases you must drive as close as is safe and practical to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway when approaching and executing a right-hand turn. The exceptions to that rule, according to the California Vehicle Code section 22100 V.C., are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Upon a roadway having three marked lanes for traffic moving in one direction that terminates at an intersecting roadway accommodating traffic in both directions, the driver of a vehicle in the middle lane may turn right into any lane lawfully available to traffic moving in that direction upon the roadway being entered.</li>
            <li>If a right-hand turn is made from a one-way roadway at an intersection, a driver shall approach the turn as provided in this subdivision and shall complete the turn in any lane lawfully available to traffic moving in that direction upon the roadway being entered.</li>
            <li>Upon a roadway having an additional lane or lanes marked for a right turn by appropriate signs or markings, the driver of a vehicle may turn right from any lane designated and marked for that turning movement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After entering an intersection with the intention of making a left-hand turn, make the left turn so that you have positioned your vehicle to exit the intersection in a lane lawfully available to traffic moving in the direction of the roadway onto which you are turning. That is except in the case of roadways with three lanes for traffic moving in one direction that terminates at an intersecting roadway accommodating traffic in both directions. In those cases, the driver of a vehicle in the middle lane may turn left into any lane lawfully available to traffic moving in that direction upon the roadway being entered.</p>
        <p>When turning left from a roadway with multiple turn lanes to a roadway with multiple lanes, consider the following example. Imagine there are three lanes for a left turn which end on Smith Street, which is a roadway with three lanes. If you are in the far left turn lane, you should end in the far left lane (or “fast lane”) on Smith Street. If you are in the middle left turn lane, you should end in the middle lane on Smith Street. And if you are in the far right left turn lane, you should end your turn in the right lane on Smith Street. If you are in the far left turn lane and end in the far right lane on Smith Street, you will have just cut off two lanes of traffic in your left turn and potentially caused several collisions, so always end in the lane you started in. </p>


        <h5><span>m.</span> Traffic breaks</h5>
        <p>Traffic breaks occur when a law enforcement officer turns on the rear emergency lights of his or her vehicle, slows the vehicle, and drives across multiple lanes of traffic in a serpentine manner. Law enforcement will use traffic breaks to slow or stop traffic to conduct emergency operations, remove hazards from the road, prevent collisions in heavy fog or unusually heavy traffic, etc.</p>
        <p>To assist or cooperate with an officer conducting a traffic break, it’s important to activate your emergency flashers to alert other drivers of the hazard and slowly decrease your speed to match that of the officer, while maintaining a safe distance from his or her vehicle. Do not attempt to drive around or past the law enforcement officer. Do not resume the normal flow of traffic until the officer has turned off the emergency lights and begins to drive in one lane. At that point, he or she is alerting that the situation has been resolved and it is now safe to return to normal speeds.</p>

        <h5><span>n.</span> Authorized Emergency Vehicles</h5>
        <p>When an authorized emergency vehicle is approaching within 1,000 feet to the front of the vehicle, with sirens sounding and at least one red light visible, the surrounding traffic shall, unless otherwise directed by a traffic officer, yield right-of-way and immediately drive to the right side of the roadway, close to the curb and clear of any intersection. The traffic shall stop there and remain stopped until the authorized emergency vehicle has passed. If a vehicle is in a carpool/High Occupancy Vehicle (H.O.V.) lane, or any other exclusive or preferential use lane, the driver shall immediately exit that lane once he or she has determined it is reasonably safe to do so. All pedestrians must proceed to the nearest curb or sidewalk and stay there until the authorized emergency vehicle has passed. </p>
        <p>No motor vehicle, other than an authorized emergency vehicle or police or traffic officer when serving as an escort, may follow within 300 feet of any authorized emergency vehicle being operated as described above.</p>
        <p>When driving on a freeway, if you are approaching a stationary authorized emergency vehicle that is displaying emergency lights, a stationary tow truck that is displaying flashing amber warning lights, or a stationary marked Department of Transportation vehicle that is displaying flashing amber warning lights, and said vehicle is next to the freeway and is not separated from the freeway by a physical barrier, then you shall approach cautiously. If it is safe to do so, you must make a lane change into a lane that is not adjacent to the vehicles listed above. If you are unable to make a lane change due to safety concerns, then you must slow to a reasonable speed, taking into consideration the weather, road and vehicle/pedestrian traffic conditions. </p>

             Warning signals are typically yellow, and warn drivers of potentially precarious situations.  They also let drivers know what is coming up on the road so they can be aware and drive accordingly.  Let’s look at some of these signs.
              </p>

                 <p>
                   When you see the above warning sign, it means that there is a traffic signal coming up ahead.  It alerts the driver that they may need to slow down to stop for the signal.

                 <p>
                   The above sign lets drivers know that the roadway they are traversing is a winding road and that they should slow their vehicles.  The sign above is typically posted along with speed limit signs.  Drivers must slow down considerably on windy roads.

                 <p>
                   The sign above is an alert that a particular road is especially slippery when wet, and that drivers must slow down if it is raining or if the road is wet for any reason.  Wet roads can lead to hydroplaning, skidding and present a hazardous road condition.

             <p>
                The shape and color of signs are clues regarding the information the sign is alerting you to. Here are the common shapes used:

                 <p>
                   A STOP sign has eight sides and is red.  It indicates that you must make a full “STOP” at any white limit line (a wide white line painted on the street) or before entering a crosswalk. If a limit line or crosswalk is not painted on the street, a stop sign means that you must stop before entering the intersection. After you come to a full stop, check for traffic and pedestrians in all directions before proceeding.

                  A three-sided red YIELD sign means you must slow down considerably and be ready to stop if necessary.  You must let any vehicle, bicyclist, or pedestrian pass before proceeding.

                 Square red and white regulatory signs’ instructions must be followed. The DO NOT ENTER sign pictured above means: do not enter any roadway or off-ramp where the sign is posted.  The WRONG WAY sign may or may not be simultaneously posted along with the DO NOT ENTER sign. If you see one or both of these signs, you must immediately drive to the side of the road and stop. It means you are or will be going against traffic. Back out or turn around to return back to the roadway you were on. If you are traveling at night and are going the wrong way, the road reflectors will shine red in your headlights.

        <h4><span>4.</span> Adjusting your driving for conditions</h4>
        <img src="../images/curriculum-clipart/clip-art-30.gif" alt="clipart of drive in rain">
        <p>As we’ve said throughout this course, driving is a complex task that requires much of the person behind the wheel. One more layer of complication comes from the environmental and road conditions. Weather can (and should!) change the way we drive, as will driving in the city versus the country. Let’s look at the different responses we ought to consider based on these varied conditions.</p>

        <h5><span>a.</span> Different road conditions (city, country, construction, congestion)</h5>
        <p>Drivers will encounter a wide variety of scenarios and conditions throughout their driving life. The key is to adjust to each of these conditions by adjusting speed and awareness of your surroundings.</p>
        <p><strong>Driving in Cities and Congestion</strong></p>
        <p>When driving in a congested city, you are likely to come across a maelstrom of pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists zipping between vehicles, one-way streets, detours, etc. If you happen to be in a city with which you are unfamiliar, this can increase your risk of collision significantly. It is best to be prepared before entering such a situation by studying city maps and knowing your route ahead of time. Use a GPS device so you won’t have to look for street names as intently, thereby moving your eyes from the road in front of you for long periods of time. Slow your speed and SCAN intently for stopped vehicles, road hazards, pedestrians, etc., throughout your route. If you miss a turn, do not try to back up or attempt some dangerous maneuver to make it. Simply continue driving and turn around when safe to do so. </p>
        <img src="../images/curriculum-images/30-xi_a_4.a.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="image of freeway traffic">
        <p>In congested situations, put on some relaxing music and slow your speed – getting frustrated and upset will not make the roadway clear. Avoid the temptation to change lanes frequently because it’s unlikely to get you through the congestion faster and will only increase your risk of a collision. Remember to be patient and courteous to other drivers. Make space for people who need to merge on or off of the roadway. This action will not delay you more than a few seconds and will do wonders for increasing the goodwill of your driving neighbors. </p>
        <p><strong>Driving in the Country</strong></p>
        <p>Country roads come with another set of dangers and stimuli. Although it is unlikely you will be swarmed with foot traffic, you may be swarmed with wildlife and farm animals. Country roads are not often maintained to the same extent of a city or suburb, so beware of potholes and large cracks in the road. Streets are often unmarked and intersections are not always regulated by traffic signs or lights. When driving in the country, expect the unexpected, drive slow enough to fully stop at a moment’s notice, slow or stop when you come to an intersection to be certain there isn’t another vehicle barreling toward you. In this scenario, as well as in city driving, familiarize yourself with your route ahead of time to be certain you can navigate the area even without road signs. </p>
        <p><strong>Driving in Construction Zones</strong></p>
        <p>Construction zones often have their own set of traffic rules that differ from that roadway under normal conditions. Typically you will see lanes ahead blocked off, forcing everyone to merge into one or two lanes, and there will be reduced speed signs along the route. Sometimes you will need to drive close to cement blocks with no shoulder. When approaching a construction zone, remember to SCAN ahead to anticipate shifts in the traffic pattern, look for signs and instructions regarding speed and lane changes and adapt accordingly. Allow traffic to merge into the allocated lanes and slow your speed. Keep an eye out for construction workers walking along the roadway and for equipment in motion. Be prepared for evasive action should the equipment or debris move unexpectedly or should traffic ahead stop suddenly. </p>
        <img src="../images/curriculum-images/10-xi_4_a.jpg" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="image of construction zone">

        <h5><span>b.</span> Different weather conditions (rain, snow, fog or sand/dust storm).</h5>
        <P>When driving in poor weather conditions, try to stay on paved roadways and follow in the path of the car in front of you. Always leave more than 3 seconds of following distance behind the car ahead because weather conditions typically lengthen the stopping time for your vehicle. Below are a few weather conditions that warrant heightened alertness and adjustment while driving.</P>
        <p><strong>Rain</strong></p>
        <p>We have already covered the dangers of hydroplaning and how to recover from it in Section V of this course, but let’s go over some basics for driving in the rain in general. First of all, you should significantly reduce your speed. Drive 5 – 10 mph slower than normal and slow a little more when traversing intersections. Be mindful of minor flooding happening along the sides of the roads and pooling around intersections, particularly in areas without adequate drainage. Light rain or the first 30 minutes of a storm cause the most danger on roadways because the water picks up the oils from the street and makes the roadways very slick. After approximately 30 minutes of rain, the oils wash away and the danger of particularly slick roads is reduced. So even though light rain seems barely worth the attention, it is actually the most dangerous time of a shower. </p>
        <p>Also remember that with wet or slippery roads, the traction between your tires and the road reduces, making the stopping distance required much greater. Be sure to leave additional room between your vehicle and the one if front of you. </p>
        <p>In heavy rain, your visibility will be reduced. If you are unable to see farther than 100 feet, you cannot safely drive faster than 30 mph! So ease off that gas pedal in the rain. Of course you must turn on your windshield wipers and headlights. Use your defroster if the windows start to fog up. Pull over where safe to do so if you need to wipe mud off of your car. </p>
        <p><strong>Snow and Ice</strong></p>
        <p>Driving in the snow or on ice will greatly reduce the traction between your tires and the road. This means much longer stopping distances will be required, so slow down and leave more than 3 seconds of following distance behind the car ahead. If you are traveling in packed snow, reduce your speed by about half. If on ice, slow to a crawl.</p>
        <p>Turn on your headlights and headlamps if you have them; use your windshield wipers and defroster when needed. If you are driving in snowy areas, be sure to have chains for your tires. (Many snowy mountain regions require you to put chains on your tires past a certain elevation.) If the snow is building up on your car, pull over when and where safe and clear it from your windshield and windows.</p>
        <p><strong>Fog</strong></p>
        <p>When driving in fog, your visibility can be severely reduced – sometimes to just a few feet in front of you! This means that you can’t see others and they can’t see you. If at all possible, delay your journey until the fog clears. <strong>The best advice for driving in fog is DON’T.</strong> If you must drive in the fog, slow to a crawl and use your low beams – not your high beams. Light from high beams will reflect back to you off of the fog and cause a glare, thereby reducing your visibility. Do not drive with just your fog lights or parking lights. Listen for traffic that you can’t see.</p>
        <p>Use your wipers if condensation is building on your windshield and increase your following distance. Cover your brakes and be prepared to stop at a moment’s notice. Do not change lanes except to execute a turn. If the fog becomes so thick that you can barely see, pull off of the road completely and wait for it to clear. Turn off your lights and do not depress the brake – this could lead other drivers behind you to think you are moving in a lane, follow your lead, and drive straight into your car.</p>
        <p><strong>Sand/Dust Storm</strong></p>
        <p>Sand or dust storms can make is nearly impossible to see. There isn’t a whole lot you can do to increase visibility in these scenarios, so you get the same advice as you did with the fog – don’t drive in it, if at all possible. If you must drive in it, slow down, increase your following distance and turn on your lights. However, it is safer to pull to the side of the road and wait for the storm to pass.</p>
